@article{aartsEstimatingReproducibilityPsychological2015,
	abstract = {Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.},

  abstract = {In the past years, network theory has successfully characterized the interaction among the constituents of a variety of complex systems, ranging from biological to technological, and social systems. However, up until recently, attention was almost exclusively given to networks in which all components were treated on equivalent footing, while neglecting all the extra information about the temporal- or context-related properties of the interactions under study. Only in the last years, taking advantage of the enhanced resolution in real data sets, network scientists have directed their interest to the multiplex character of real-world systems, and explicitly considered the time-varying and multilayer nature of networks. We offer here a comprehensive review on both structural and dynamical organization of graphs made of diverse relationships (layers) between its constituents, and cover several relevant issues, from a full redefinition of the basic structural measures, to understanding how the multilayer nature of the network affects processes and dynamics.},

For each class the connexion to the original physical model and techniques are outlined underlining both the similarities and the differences. Emphasis is put on the numerous novel and counterintuitive results obtained with respect to the associated social and political framework. Using these models several major real political events were successfully predicted including the victory of the French extreme right party in the 2000 first round of French presidential elections, the voting at fifty{\textendash}fifty in several democratic countries (Germany, Italy, Mexico), and the victory of the "no" to the 2005 French referendum on the European constitution.

The two-clique graph is composed of two cliques interconnected by some links and considered as a toy model of networks with community structure or multilayer networks. I analytically show that, as the number of interclique links per node is varied, the mean consensus time experiences a crossover between a fast consensus regime [i.e., O(N)] and a slow consensus regime [i.e., O(N2)], where N is the number of nodes. The fast regime is consistent with the result for homogeneous well-mixed graphs such as the complete graph. The slow regime appears only when the entire network has O(1) interclique links. The present results suggest that the effect of community structure on the consensus time of the voter model is fairly limited.},

  abstract = {We present a new model of opinion changes dependent on the agents emotional state and their information about the issue in question. Our goal is to construct a simple, yet nontrivial and flexible representation of individual attitude dynamics for agent based simulations, that could be used in a variety of social environments. The model is a discrete version of the cusp catastrophe model of opinion dynamics in which information is treated as the normal factor while emotional arousal (agitation level determining agent receptiveness and rationality) is treated as the splitting factor. Both variables determine the resulting agent opinion, which itself can be in favor of the studied position, against it, or neutral. Thanks to the flexibility of implementing communication between the agents, the model is potentially applicable in a wide range of situations. As an example of the model application, we study the dynamics of a set of agents communicating among themselves via messages. In the example, we chose the simplest, fully connected communication topology, to focus on the effects of the individual opinion dynamics, and to look for stable final distributions of agents with different emotions, information and opinions. Even for such simplified system, the model shows complex behavior, including phase transitions due to symmetry breaking by external propaganda.},

A variation of a mathematical model that was developed for the immune system network is interpreted in the context of the central nervous system. This model involves a hypothetical neuron that exhibits hysteresis. The mathematical model of a network of N neurons is a system of N coupled ordinary differential equations that has almost 2N attractors. Numerical experiments are described that show it is possible to ``teach'' such a system to exhibit prespecified stimulus-response behavior, without the occurrence of changes in synaptic connection strengths. The learned information in this system resides in an N-dimensional state vector rather than in the N2 strengths of connections between neurons, which are held fixed. For the purposes of artificial intelligence applications, it is therefore possible to use synaptic connection matrices that have special symmetry properties, and for which rapid convolution computational techniques are applicable.},

An understanding of those tipping elements is of great interest given the increasing influence of humans on the biophysical Earth system. Complex interactions exist between tipping elements, e.g. physical mechanisms connect subsystems of the climate system. Based on earlier work on such coupled nonlinear systems, we systematically assessed the qualitative long-term behaviour of interacting tipping elements. We developed an understanding of the consequences of interactions on the tipping behaviour allowing for tipping cascades to emerge under certain conditions. The (narrative) application of these qualitative results to real-world examples of interacting tipping elements indicates that tipping cascades with profound consequences may occur: the interacting Greenland ice sheet and thermohaline ocean circulation might tip before the tipping points of the isolated subsystems are crossed. The eutrophication of the first lake in a lake chain might propagate through the following lakes without a crossing of their individual critical nutrient input levels.

  abstract = {A number of tipping elements in the Earth system have been identified among which the oceanic meridional overturning circulation. Here, we focus on the impact of the threshold behaviour of this large-scale subsystem on other coupled climate subsystems. We introduce a framework of (directionally) coupled tipping elements exhibiting \{cascading tipping\}, i.e. a sequence of abrupt transitions as tipping in one subsystem changes the background conditions for another subsystem. A mathematical framework of elementary deterministic cascading tipping points in autonomous dynamical systems is presented containing the double-fold, fold-Hopf, Hopf-fold and double-Hopf as the most generic cases. The potential of cascading tipping in the climate system is illustrated through conceptual models of the ocean circulation coupled to (i) the El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system and (ii) the Antarctic land ice sheet.

Ten years later, Kadyrov combined two of these cusps into a model for the opinion dynamics of two "nonsocialist" nations. This is a nongradient dynamical system, more general than the double-cusp catastrophe studied by Callahan and Sashin [1987]. Here, we present a computational study of the nongradient double cusp, in which the degeneracy of Kadyrov's model is unfolded in codimension eight. Also, we develop a discrete-time cusp model, study the corresponding double cusp, establish its equivalence to the continuous-time double cusp, and discuss some potential applications. We find bifurcations for multiple critical-point attractors, periodic attractors, and (for the discrete case) bifurcations to quasiperiodic and chaotic attractors.},

	abstract = {Ethological attachment theory is a landmark of 20th century social and behavioral sciences theory and research. This new paradigm for understanding primary relationships across the lifespan evolved from John Bowlby's critique of psychoanalytic drive theory and his own clinical observations, supplemented by his knowledge of fields as diverse as primate ethology, control systems theory, and cognitive psychology. By the time he had written the first volume of his classic Attachment and Loss trilogy, Mary D. Salter Ainsworth's naturalistic observations in Uganda and Baltimore, and her theoretical and descriptive insights about maternal care and the secure base phenomenon had become integral to attachment theory.  Patterns of Attachment reports the methods and key results of Ainsworth's landmark Baltimore Longitudinal Study. Following upon her naturalistic home observations in Uganda, the Baltimore project yielded a wealth of enduring, benchmark results on the nature of the child's tie to its primary caregiver and the importance of early experience. It also addressed a wide range of conceptual and methodological issues common to many developmental and longitudinal projects, especially issues of age appropriate assessment, quantifying behavior, and comprehending individual differences. In addition, Ainsworth and her students broke new ground, clarifying and defining new concepts, demonstrating the value of the ethological methods and insights about behavior. Today, as we enter the fourth generation of attachment study, we have a rich and growing catalogue of behavioral and narrative approaches to measuring attachment from infancy to adulthood. Each of them has roots in the Strange Situation and the secure base concept presented in Patterns of Attachment. It inclusion in the Psychology Press Classic Editions series reflects Patterns of Attachment's continuing significance and insures its availability to new generations of students, researchers, and clinicians.},

Specifically, we study synchronization and entrainment in networks of heterogeneous RvdP oscillators and contrast the effects of diffusive linear coupling strategies with the nonlinear Haken\textendash Kelso\textendash Bunz coupling, originally introduced to study human bimanual experiments. We show how convergence of the error among the nodes' trajectories toward a bounded region is possible with both linear and nonlinear coupling functions. Under the assumption that the network is connected, simple, and undirected, analytical results are obtained to prove boundedness of the error when the oscillators are coupled diffusively. All results are illustrated by way of numerical examples and compared with the experimental findings available in the literature on synchronization of people rocking chairs, confirming the effectiveness of the model we propose to capture some of the features of human group synchronization observed experimentally in the previous literature.},

This article reviews these regression analysis procedures. The problems in the approach are detailed, then demonstrated with computer-generated data sets.

@article{almaatouqAdaptiveSocialNetworks2020,
	abstract = {Social networks continuously change as new ties are created and existing ones fade. It is widely acknowledged that our social embedding has a substantial impact on what information we receive and how we form beliefs and make decisions. However, most empirical studies on the role of social networks in collective intelligence have overlooked the dynamic nature of social networks and its role in fostering adaptive collective intelligence. Therefore, little is known about how groups of individuals dynamically modify their local connections and, accordingly, the topology of the network of interactions to respond to changing environmental conditions. In this paper, we address this question through a series of behavioral experiments and supporting simulations. Our results reveal that, in the presence of plasticity and feedback, social networks can adapt to biased and changing information environments and produce collective estimates that are more accurate than their best-performing member. To explain these results, we explore two mechanisms: 1) a global-adaptation mechanism where the structural connectivity of the network itself changes such that it amplifies the estimates of high-performing members within the group (i.e., the network ``edges'' encode the computation); and 2) a local-adaptation mechanism where accurate individuals are more resistant to social influence (i.e., adjustments to the attributes of the ``node'' in the network); therefore, their initial belief is disproportionately weighted in the collective estimate. Our findings substantiate the role of social-network plasticity and feedback as key adaptive mechanisms for refining individual and collective judgments.},

Although organization scientists have studied complex organizations for many years, a developing set of conceptual and computational tools makes possible new approaches to modeling nonlinear interactions within and between organizations. Complex adaptive system models represent a genuinely new way of simplifying the complex. They are characterized by four key elements: agents with schemata, self-organizing networks sustained by importing energy, coevolution to the edge of chaos, and system evolution based on recombination. New types of models that incorporate these elements will push organization science forward by merging empirical observation with computational agent-based simulation. Applying complex adaptive systems models to strategic management leads to an emphasis on building systems that can rapidly evolve effective adaptive solutions. Strategic direction of complex organizations consists of establishing and modifying environments within which effective, improvised, self-organized solutions can evolve. Managers influence strategic behavior by altering the fitness landscape for local agents and reconfiguring the organizational architecture within which agents adapt.},

An agent-based adaptive model reveals the effects of a mechanism of convergent social influence. The actors are placed at fixed sites. The basic premise is that the more similar an actor is to a neighbor, the more likely that that actor will adopt one of the neighbor's traits. Unlike previous models of social influence or cultural change that treat features one at a time, the proposed model takes into account the interaction between different features. The model illustrates how local convergence can generate global polarization. Simulations show that the number of stable homogeneous regions decreases with the number of features, increases with the number of alternative traits per feature, decreases with the range of interaction, and (most surprisingly) decreases when the geographic territory grows beyond a certain size.},

We introduce a two-gang Hamiltonian model where agents have red or blue affiliation but are otherwise indistinguishable. In this model, all interactions are indirect and occur only via graffiti markings, on-site as well as on nearest neighbor locations. We also allow for gang proliferation and graffiti suppression. Within the context of this model, we show that gang clustering and territory formation may arise under specific parameter choices and that a phase transition may occur between well-mixed, possibly dilute configurations and well separated, clustered ones. Using methods from statistical mechanics, we study the phase transition between these two qualitatively different scenarios. In the mean-fields rendition of this model, we identify parameter regimes where the transition is first or second order. In all cases, we have found that the transitions are a consequence solely of the gang to graffiti couplings, implying that direct gang to gang interactions are not strictly necessary for gang territory formation; in particular, graffiti may be the sole driving force behind gang clustering. We further discuss possible sociological\textemdash as well as ecological\textemdash ramifications of our results.},

The authors argue the reason for this confusion is a failure to specify various dimensions along which transfer can occur, resulting in comparisons of "apples and oranges." They provide a framework that describes 9 relevant dimensions and show that the literature can productively be classified along these dimensions, with each study situated at the intersection of various dimensions. Estimation of a single effect size for far transfer is misguided in view of this complexity. The past 100 years of research shows that evidence for transfer under some conditions is substantial, but critical conditions for many key questions are untested.

Yet the majority of studies on mutualistic interactions have involved only a few species, as opposed to broader mutual connections between communities of organisms. Mutualistic Networks is the first book to comprehensively explore this burgeoning field. Integrating different approaches, from the statistical description of network structures to the development of new analytical frameworks, Jordi Bascompte and Pedro Jordano describe the architecture of these mutualistic networks and show their importance for the robustness of biodiversity and the coevolutionary process. Making a case for why we should care about mutualisms and their complex networks, this book offers a new perspective on the study and synthesis of this growing area for ecologists and evolutionary biologists. It will serve as the standard reference for all future work on mutualistic interactions in biological communities.},

However, networks are intrinsically limited to describing pairwise interactions, whereas real-world systems are often characterized by higher-order interactions involving groups of three or more units. Higher-order structures, such as hypergraphs and simplicial complexes, are therefore a better tool to map the real organization of many social, biological and man-made systems. Here, we highlight recent evidence of collective behaviours induced by higher-order interactions, and we outline three key challenges for the physics of higher-order systems.},

Such explanations depart in numerous ways from nomological explanations commonly presented in philosophy of science. This paper focuses on three sorts of differences. First, scientists who develop mechanistic explanations are not limited to linguistic representations and logical inference; they frequently employ diagrams to characterize mechanisms and simulations to reason about them. Thus, the epistemic resources for presenting mechanistic explanations are considerably richer than those suggested by a nomological framework. Second, the fact that mechanisms involve organized systems of component parts and operations provides direction to both the discovery and testing of mechanistic explanations. Finally, models of mechanisms are developed for specific exemplars and are not represented in terms of universally quantified statements. Generalization involves investigating both the similarity of new exemplars to those already studied and the variations between them.},

We analyze how the type of dynamics (ordered or chaotic) exhibited by randomly connected networks of threshold gates driven by a time-varying input signal depends on the parameters describing the distribution of the connectivity matrix. In particular, we calculate the critical boundary in parameter space where the transition from ordered to chaotic dynamics takes place. Employing a recently developed framework for analyzing real-time computations, we show that only near the critical boundary can such networks perform complex computations on time series. Hence, this result strongly supports conjectures that dynamical systems that are capable of doing complex computational tasks should operate near the edge of chaos, that is, the transition from ordered to chaotic dynamics.},

Fundamental to the network theory of psychopathology is the role of specific symptoms and their interactions. Current statistical tools, however, fail to fully capture this constitutional property. We propose community detection tools as a means to evaluate the complex network structure of psychopathology, free from its original boundaries of distinct disorders. Unique to this approach is that symptoms can belong to multiple communities. Using a large community sample and spanning a broad range of symptoms (Symptom Checklist-90-Revised), we identified 18 communities of interconnected symptoms. The differential role of symptoms within and between communities offers a framework to study the clinical concepts of comorbidity, heterogeneity and hallmark symptoms. Symptoms with many and strong connections within a community, defined as stabilizing symptoms, could be thought of as the core of a community, whereas symptoms that belong to multiple communities, defined as communicating symptoms, facilitate the communication between problem areas. We propose that defining symptoms on their stabilizing and/or communicating role within and across communities accelerates our understanding of these clinical phenomena, central to research and treatment of psychopathology.},

The first approach to capture the global properties of such systems is to model them as graphs whose nodes represent the dynamical units, and whose links stand for the interactions between them. On the one hand, scientists have to cope with structural issues, such as characterizing the topology of a complex wiring architecture, revealing the unifying principles that are at the basis of real networks, and developing models to mimic the growth of a network and reproduce its structural properties. On the other hand, many relevant questions arise when studying complex networks' dynamics, such as learning how a large ensemble of dynamical systems that interact through a complex wiring topology can behave collectively. We review the major concepts and results recently achieved in the study of the structure and dynamics of complex networks, and summarize the relevant applications of these ideas in many different disciplines, ranging from nonlinear science to biology, from statistical mechanics to medicine and engineering.},

The Common Factor Model (CFM) models the relations between the observed indicators and the latent variable. In this article we argue in favor of interpreting the CFM as a causal model rather than merely a statistical model, in which common factors are only descriptions of the indicators. When there is sufficient reason to hypothesize that the underlying causal structure of the data is a common cause structure, a causal interpretation of the CFM has several benefits over a merely statistical interpretation of the model. We argue that (1) a causal interpretation conforms with most research questions in which the goal is to explain the correlations between indicators rather than merely summarizing them; (2) a causal interpretation of the factor model legitimizes the focus on shared, rather than unique variance of the indicators; and (3) a causal interpretation of the factor model legitimizes the assumption of local independence.},

@article{borsboomFalseAlarmComprehensive2017,
	abstract = {Forbes, Wright, Markon, and Krueger (2017) stated that ``psychopathology networks have limited replicability'' (p. 1011) and that ``popular network analysis methods produce unreliable results'' (p. 1011). These conclusions are based on an assessment of the replicability of four different network models for symptoms of major depression and generalized anxiety across two samples; in addition, Forbes et al. analyzed the stability of the network models within the samples using split-halves. Our reanalysis of the same data with the same methods led to results directly opposed to theirs: All network models replicated very well across the two data sets and across the split-halves. We trace the differences between Forbes et al.'s results and our own to the fact that they did not appear to accurately implement all network models and used debatable metrics to assess replicability. In particular, they deviated from existing estimation routines for relative importance networks, did not acknowledge the fact that the skip structure used in the interviews strongly distorted correlations between symptoms, and incorrectly assumed that network structures and metrics should be the same not only across the different samples but also across the different network models used. In addition to a comprehensive reanalysis of the data, we end with a discussion of best practices concerning future research into the replicability of psychometric networks.

Although the network approach has led to many novel methodologies and substantive applications, it has not yet been fully articulated as a scientific theory of mental disorders. The present paper aims to develop such a theory, by postulating a limited set of theoretical principles regarding the structure and dynamics of symptom networks. At the heart of the theory lies the notion that symptoms of psychopathology are causally connected through myriads of biological, psychological and societal mechanisms. If these causal relations are sufficiently strong, symptoms can generate a level of feedback that renders them self-sustaining. In this case, the network can get stuck in a disorder state. The network theory holds that this is a general feature of mental disorders, which can therefore be understood as alternative stable states of strongly connected symptom networks. This idea naturally leads to a comprehensive model of psychopathology, encompassing a common explanatory model for mental disorders, as well as novel definitions of associated concepts such as mental health, resilience, vulnerability and liability. In addition, the network theory has direct implications for how to understand diagnosis and treatment, and suggests a clear agenda for future research in psychiatry and associated disciplines.},

We explain empirical comorbidity patterns based on a network model of psychiatric symptoms, derived from an analysis of symptom overlap in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV). Principal Findings We show that a) half of the symptoms in the DSM-IV network are connected, b) the architecture of these connections conforms to a small world structure, featuring a high degree of clustering but a short average path length, and c) distances between disorders in this structure predict empirical comorbidity rates. Network simulations of Major Depressive Episode and Generalized Anxiety Disorder show that the model faithfully reproduces empirical population statistics for these disorders. Conclusions In the network model, mental disorders are inherently complex. This explains the limited successes of genetic, neuroscientific, and etiological approaches to unravel their causes. We outline a psychosystems approach to investigate the structure and dynamics of mental disorders.},

@article{borsboomTheoryConstructionMethodology2021,
	abstract = {This article aims to improve theory formation in psychology by developing a practical methodology for constructing explanatory theories: theory construction methodology (TCM). TCM is a sequence of five steps. First, the theorist identifies a domain of empirical phenomena that becomes the target of explanation. Second, the theorist constructs a prototheory, a set of theoretical principles that putatively explain these phenomena. Third, the prototheory is used to construct a formal model, a set of model equations that encode explanatory principles. Fourth, the theorist investigates the explanatory adequacy of the model by formalizing its empirical phenomena and assessing whether it indeed reproduces these phenomena. Fifth, the theorist studies the overall adequacy of the theory by evaluating whether the identified phenomena are indeed reproduced faithfully and whether the explanatory principles are sufficiently parsimonious and substantively plausible. We explain TCM with an example taken from research on intelligence (the mutualism model of intelligence), in which key elements of the method have been successfully implemented. We discuss the place of TCM in the larger scheme of scientific research and propose an outline for a university curriculum that can systematically educate psychologists in the process of theory formation.},

@article{bringmannWhatCentralityMeasures2019,
	abstract = {Centrality indices are a popular tool to analyze structural aspects of psychological networks. As centrality indices were originally developed in the context of social networks, it is unclear to what extent these indices are suitable in a psychological network context. In this article we critically examine several issues with the use of the most popular centrality indices in psychological networks: degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality. We show that problems with centrality indices discussed in the social network literature also apply to the psychological networks. Assumptions underlying centrality indices, such as presence of a flow and shortest paths, may not correspond with a general theory of how psychological variables relate to one another. Furthermore, the assumptions of node distinctiveness and node exchangeability may not hold in psychological networks. We conclude that, for psychological networks, betweenness and closeness centrality seem especially unsuitable as measures of node importance. We therefore suggest three ways forward: (a) using centrality measures that are tailored to the psychological network context, (b) reconsidering existing measures of importance used in statistical models underlying psychological networks, and (c) discarding the concept of node centrality entirely. Foremost, we argue that one has to make explicit what one means when one states that a node is central, and what assumptions the centrality measure of choice entails, to make sure that there is a match between the process under study and the centrality measure that is used.

We present the methods we use to both steer and analyze this system in real-time, using scoring rules on accuracy and response times, a tailored rating system to provide both learners and items with current ability and difficulty ratings, and an adaptive engine that matches learners to items. Moreover, we explore the quality of fit by means of prediction accuracy and parallel item reliability. Limitations and pitfalls are discussed by diagnosing sources of misfit, like violations of unidimensionality and unforeseen dynamics. Finally, directions for development are discussed, including embedded learning analytics and a focus on online experimentation to evaluate both the system itself and the users' learning gains. Though many challenges remain open, we believe that large steps have been made in providing methods to efficiently manage and research educational big data from a massive online learning system.},

@article{brushConflictsInterestImprove2018,
	abstract = {In many biological systems, the functional behavior of a group is collectively computed by the system's individual components. An example is the brain's ability to make decisions via the activity of billions of neurons. A long-standing puzzle is how the components' decisions combine to produce beneficial group-level outputs, despite conflicts of interest and imperfect information. We derive a theoretical model of collective computation from mechanistic first principles, using results from previous work on the computation of power structure in a primate model system. Collective computation has two phases: an information accumulation phase, in which (in this study) pairs of individuals gather information about their fighting abilities and make decisions about their dominance relationships, and an information aggregation phase, in which these decisions are combined to produce a collective computation. To model information accumulation, we extend a stochastic decision-making model-the leaky integrator model used to study neural decision-making-to a multiagent game-theoretic framework. We then test alternative algorithms for aggregating information-in this study, decisions about dominance resulting from the stochastic model-and measure the mutual information between the resultant power structure and the "true" fighting abilities. We find that conflicts of interest can improve accuracy to the benefit of all agents. We also find that the computation can be tuned to produce different power structures by changing the cost of waiting for a decision. The successful application of a similar stochastic decision-making model in neural and social contexts suggests general principles of collective computation across substrates and scales.},

A lack of such reporting standards may foster researcher degrees of freedom and could provide fertile ground for questionable reporting practices. Here, we introduce reporting standards for network analyses in cross-sectional data, along with a tutorial and two examples. The presented guidelines are aimed at researchers as well as the broader scientific community, such as reviewers and journal editors evaluating scientific work.

@misc{burgEvaluationChangePoint2022,
	abstract = {Change point detection is an important part of time series analysis, as the presence of a change point indicates an abrupt and significant change in the data generating process. While many algorithms for change point detection have been proposed, comparatively little attention has been paid to evaluating their performance on real-world time series. Algorithms are typically evaluated on simulated data and a small number of commonly-used series with unreliable ground truth. Clearly this does not provide sufficient insight into the comparative performance of these algorithms. Therefore, instead of developing yet another change point detection method, we consider it vastly more important to properly evaluate existing algorithms on real-world data. To achieve this, we present a data set specifically designed for the evaluation of change point detection algorithms that consists of 37 time series from various application domains. Each series was annotated by five human annotators to provide ground truth on the presence and location of change points. We analyze the consistency of the human annotators, and describe evaluation metrics that can be used to measure algorithm performance in the presence of multiple ground truth annotations. Next, we present a benchmark study where 14 algorithms are evaluated on each of the time series in the data set. Our aim is that this data set will serve as a proving ground in the development of novel change point detection algorithms.},

They introduce the foundations for modelling probabilistic-dynamic systems using two aspects of quantum theory. The first, 'contextuality', is a way to understand interference effects found with inferences and decisions under conditions of uncertainty. The second, 'quantum entanglement', allows cognitive phenomena to be modeled in non-reductionist ways. Employing these principles drawn from quantum theory allows us to view human cognition and decision in a totally new light. Introducing the basic principles in an easy-to-follow way, this book does not assume a physics background or a quantum brain and comes complete with a tutorial and fully worked-out applications in important areas of cognition and decision.},

  abstract = {A neural network architecture for the learning of recognition categories is derived. Real-time network dynamics are completely characterized through mathematical analysis and computer simulations. The architecture self-organizes and self-stabilizes its recognition codes in response to arbitrary orderings of arbitrarily many and arbitrarily complex binary input patterns. Top-down attentional and matching mechanisms are critical in self-stabilizing the code learning process. The architecture embodies a parallel search scheme which updates itself adaptively as the learning process unfolds. After learning self-stabilizes, the search process is automatically disengaged. Thereafter input patterns directly access their recognition codes without any search. Thus recognition time does not grow as a function of code complexity. A novel input pattern can directly access a category if it shares invariant properties with the set of familiar exemplars of that category. These invariant properties emerge in the form of learned critical feature patterns, or prototypes. The architecture possesses a context-sensitive self-scaling property which enables its emergent critical feature patterns to form. They detect and remember statistically predictive configurations of featural elements which are derived from the set of all input patterns that are ever experienced. Four types of attentional process---priming, gain control, vigilance, and intermodal competition---are mechanistically characterized. Top---down priming and gain control are needed for code matching and self-stabilization. Attentional vigilance determines how fine the learned categories will be. If vigilance increases due to an environmental disconfirmation, then the system automatically searches for and learns finer recognition categories. A new nonlinear matching law (the {$\frac{2}{3}$} Rule) and new nonlinear associative laws (the Weber Law Rule, the Associative Decay Rule, and the Template Learning Rule) are needed to achieve these properties. All the rules describe emergent properties of parallel network interactions. The architecture circumvents the noise, saturation, capacity, orthogonality, and linear predictability constraints that limit the codes which can be stably learned by alternative recognition models.}

This view has been challenged by evidence that many disorders are sequentially comorbid, recurrent/chronic, and exist on a continuum. Using the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, we examined the structure of psychopathology, taking into account dimensionality, persistence, co-occurrence, and sequential comorbidity of mental disorders across 20 years, from adolescence to midlife. Psychiatric disorders were initially explained by three higher-order factors (Internalizing, Externalizing, and Thought Disorder) but explained even better with one General Psychopathology dimension. We have called this dimension the p factor because it conceptually parallels a familiar dimension in psychological science: the g factor of general intelligence. Higher p scores are associated with more life impairment, greater familiality, worse developmental histories, and more compromised early-life brain function. The p factor explains why it is challenging to find causes, consequences, biomarkers, and treatments with specificity to individual mental disorders.

	abstract = {We introduce a nonlinear variant of the voter model, the q-voter model, in which q neighbors (with possible repetition) are consulted for a voter to change opinion. If the q neighbors agree, the voter takes their opinion; if they do not have a unanimous opinion, still a voter can flip its state with probability {$\epsilon$}. We solve the model on a fully connected network (i.e., in mean field) and compute the exit probability as well as the average time to reach consensus by employing the backward Fokker-Planck formalism and scaling arguments. We analyze the results in the perspective of a recently proposed Langevin equation aimed at describing generic phase transitions in systems with two (Z2-symmetric) absorbing states. In particular, by deriving explicitly the coefficients of such a Langevin equation as a function of the microscopic flipping probabilities, we find that in mean field the q-voter model exhibits a disordered phase for high {$\epsilon$} and an ordered one for low {$\epsilon$} with three possible ways to go from one to the other: (i) a unique (generalized-voter-like) transition, (ii) a series of two consecutive transitions, one (Ising-like) in which the Z2 symmetry is broken and a separate one (in the directed-percolation class) in which the system falls into an absorbing state, and (iii) a series of two transitions, including an intermediate regime in which the final state depends on initial conditions. This third (so far unexplored) scenario, in which a type of ordering dynamics emerges, is rationalized and found to be specific of mean field, i.e., fluctuations are explicitly shown to wash it out in spatially extended systems.},

	abstract = {Why psychology is in peril as a scientific discipline\textemdash and how to save it Psychological science has made extraordinary discoveries about the human mind, but can we trust everything its practitioners are telling us? In recent years, it has become increasingly apparent that a lot of research in psychology is based on weak evidence, questionable practices, and sometimes even fraud. The Seven Deadly Sins of Psychology diagnoses the ills besetting the discipline today and proposes sensible, practical solutions to ensure that it remains a legitimate and reliable science in the years ahead. In this unflinchingly candid manifesto, Chris Chambers draws on his own experiences as a working scientist to reveal a dark side to psychology that few of us ever see. Using the seven deadly sins as a metaphor, he shows how practitioners are vulnerable to powerful biases that undercut the scientific method, how they routinely torture data until it produces outcomes that can be published in prestigious journals, and how studies are much less reliable than advertised. He reveals how a culture of secrecy denies the public and other researchers access to the results of psychology experiments, how fraudulent academics can operate with impunity, and how an obsession with bean counting creates perverse incentives for academics. Left unchecked, these problems threaten the very future of psychology as a science\textemdash but help is here. Outlining a core set of best practices that can be applied across the sciences, Chambers demonstrates how all these sins can be corrected by embracing open science, an emerging philosophy that seeks to make research and its outcomes as transparent as possible.},

While cross-sectional results indicated that vaccination intention was relatively strongly related to attitudes toward the vaccines, results from temporal analyses showed that vaccination intention mainly predicted other vaccination-related variables and to a lesser extent was predicted by variables. We found a weak predictive effect from social norm to vaccination intention that was not robust. This study underlines the challenge of stimulating uptake of new vaccines developed during pandemics, and the importance of examining directions of effects in research into vaccination intention.},

Radical embodied cognitive science is an interdisciplinary approach to psychology that combines ideas from the phenomenological tradition with ecological psychology and dynamical systems modeling. It is argued that radical embodied cognitive science has a long history; it is as a direct descendent of the Jamesian functionalist approach to psychology. This approach to psychology is contrasted with the current trend of supplementing standard cognitive psychology with occasional references to the body. In contrast with these trends, radical embodied cognitive science is skeptical of the explanatory usefulness of mental representations. The future prospects of radical embodied cognitive science and the broader functionalist framework are discussed.},

One barrier to broader application is the lack of resources for researchers unfamiliar with the approach. Another barrier, for both the unfamiliar and knowledgeable researcher, is the tedious and laborious preprocessing of semantic data. We aim to minimize these barriers by offering a comprehensive semantic network analysis pipeline (preprocessing, estimating, and analyzing networks), and an associated R tutorial that uses a suite of R packages to accommodate the pipeline. Two of these packages, SemNetDictionaries and SemNetCleaner, promote an efficient, reproducible, and transparent approach to preprocessing linguistic data. The third package, SemNeT, provides methods and measures for estimating and statistically comparing semantic networks via a point-and-click graphical user interface. Using real-world data, we present a start-to-finish pipeline from raw data to semantic network analysis results. This article aims to provide resources for researchers, both the unfamiliar and knowledgeable, that reduce some of the barriers for conducting semantic network analysis.

The sensations which are misinterpreted are mainly those involved in normal anxiety responses (e.g. palpitations, breathlessness, dizziness etc.) but also include some other sensations. The catastrophic misinterpretation involves perceiving these sensations as much more dangerous than they really are (e.g. perceiving palpitations as evidence of an impending heart attack). A review of the literature indicates that the proposed model is consistent with the major features of panic. In particular, it is consistent with the nature of the cognitive disturbance in panic patients, the perceived sequence of events in an attack, the occurrence of `spontaneous' attacks, the role of hyperventilation in attacks, the effects of sodium lactate and the literature on psychological and pharmacological treatments. Finally, a series of direct tests of the model are proposed.},

They are bundles of cells that support perception and action by constantly attempting to match incoming sensory inputs with top-down expectations or predictions.

Such accounts offer a unifying model of perception and action, illuminate the functional role of attention, and may neatly capture the special contribution of cortical processing to adaptive success. This target article critically examines this ``hierarchical prediction machine'' approach, concluding that it offers the best clue yet to the shape of a unified science of mind and action. Sections 1 and 2 lay out the key elements and implications of the approach. Section 3 explores a variety of pitfalls and challenges, spanning the evidential, the methodological, and the more properly conceptual.

We propose a method to visualize comorbidity networks and, based on an empirical network for major depression and generalized anxiety, we argue that this approach generates realistic hypotheses about pathways to comorbidity, overlapping symptoms, and diagnostic boundaries, that are not naturally accommodated by latent variable models: Some pathways to comorbidity through the symptom space are more likely than others; those pathways generally have the same direction (i.e., from symptoms of one disorder to symptoms of the other); overlapping symptoms play an important role in comorbidity; and boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily fuzzy.},

@article{crielaardRefiningCausalLoop2022,
	abstract = {Complexity science and systems thinking are increasingly recognized as relevant paradigms for studying systems where biology, psychology, and socioenvironmental factors interact. The application of systems thinking, however, often stops at developing a conceptual model that visualizes the mapping of causal links within a system, e.g., a causal loop diagram (CLD). While this is an important contribution in itself, it is imperative to subsequently formulate a computable version of a CLD in order to interpret the dynamics of the modeled system and simulate "what if" scenarios. We propose to realize this by deriving knowledge from experts' mental models in biopsychosocial domains. This article first describes the steps required for capturing expert knowledge in a CLD such that it may result in a computational system dynamics model (SDM). For this purpose, we introduce several annotations to the CLD that facilitate this intended conversion. This annotated CLD (aCLD) includes sources of evidence, intermediary variables, functional forms of causal links, and the distinction between uncertain and known-to-be-absent causal links. We propose an algorithm for developing an aCLD that includes these annotations. We then describe how to formulate an SDM based on the aCLD. The described steps for this conversion help identify, quantify, and potentially reduce sources of uncertainty and obtain confidence in the results of the SDM's simulations. We utilize a running example that illustrates each step of this conversion process. The systematic approach described in this article facilitates and advances the application of computational science methods to biopsychosocial systems.

@article{dablanderAnticipatingCriticalTransitions2022,
	abstract = {Many real-world systems can exhibit tipping points and multiple stable states, creating the potential for sudden and difficult to reverse transitions into a less desirable regime. The theory of dynamical systems points to the existence of generic early warning signals that may precede these so-called critical transitions. Recently, psychologists have begun to conceptualize mental disorders such as depression as an alternative stable state, and suggested that early warning signals based on the phenomenon of critical slowing down might be useful for predicting transitions into depression and other psychiatric disorders. Harnessing the potential of early warning signals requires us to understand their limitations as well as the factors influencing their performance in practice. In this article, we (a) review limitations of early warning signals based on critical slowing down to better understand when they can and cannot occur, and (b) study the conditions under which early warning signals may anticipate critical transitions in online-monitoring settings by simulating from a bistable dynamical system, varying crucial features such as sampling frequency, noise intensity, and speed of approaching the tipping point. We find that, in sharp contrast to their reputation of being generic or model-agnostic, whether early warning signals occur or not strongly depends on the specifics of the system. We also find that they are very sensitive to noise, potentially limiting their utility in practical applications. We discuss the implications of our findings and provide suggestions and recommendations for future research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Network models have become a valuable tool in making sense of a diverse range of social, biological, and information systems. These models marry graph and probability theory to visualize, understand, and interpret variables and their relations as nodes and edges in a graph. Many applications of network models rely on undirected graphs in which the absence of an edge between two nodes encodes conditional independence between the corresponding variables. To gauge the importance of nodes in such a network, various node centrality measures have become widely used, especially in psychology and neuroscience. It is intuitive to interpret nodes with high centrality measures as being important in a causal sense. Using the causal framework based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), we show that the relation between causal influence and node centrality measures is not straightforward. In particular, the correlation between causal influence and several node centrality measures is weak, except for eigenvector centrality. Our results provide a cautionary tale: if the underlying real-world system can be modeled as a DAG, but researchers interpret nodes with high centrality as causally important, then this may result in sub-optimal interventions.},

The model rests on the assumption that implicit measures limit attitudinal entropy reduction, because implicit measures represent a measurement outcome that is the result of evaluating the attitude object in a quick and effortless manner. Implicit measures therefore assess attitudes in high entropy states (i.e., inconsistent and unstable states). In a simulation, we illustrate the implications of our network theory for implicit measures. The results of this simulation show a paradoxical result: Implicit measures can provide a more accurate assessment of conflicting evaluative reactions to an attitude object (e.g., evaluative reactions not in line with the dominant evaluative reactions) than explicit measures, because they assess these properties in a noisier and less reliable manner. We conclude that our network theory of attitudes increases the connection between substantive theorizing on attitudes and psychometric properties of implicit measures.

The AE framework rests on three propositions. First, attitude inconsistency and instability are two related indications of attitudinal entropy, a measure of randomness derived from thermodynamics. Second, energy of attitude configurations serves as a local processing strategy to reduce the global entropy of attitude networks. Third, directing attention to and thinking about attitude objects reduces attitudinal entropy. We first discuss several determinants of attitudinal entropy reduction and show that several findings in the attitude literature, such as the mere thought effect on attitude polarization and the effects of heuristic versus systematic processing of arguments, follow from the AE framework. Second, we discuss the AE framework's implications for ambivalence and cognitive dissonance. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

@article{dalegeFormalizedAccountAttitudes2016,
	abstract = {This article introduces the Causal Attitude Network (CAN) model, which conceptualizes attitudes as networks consisting of evaluative reactions and interactions between these reactions. Relevant evaluative reactions include beliefs, feelings, and behaviors toward the attitude object. Interactions between these reactions arise through direct causal influences (e.g., the belief that snakes are dangerous causes fear of snakes) and mechanisms that support evaluative consistency between related contents of evaluative reactions (e.g., people tend to align their belief that snakes are useful with their belief that snakes help maintain ecological balance). In the CAN model, the structure of attitude networks conforms to a small-world structure: evaluative reactions that are similar to each other form tight clusters, which are connected by a sparser set of ``shortcuts'' between them. We argue that the CAN model provides a realistic formalized measurement model of attitudes and therefore fills a crucial gap in the attitude literature. Furthermore, the CAN model provides testable predictions for the structure of attitudes and how they develop, remain stable, and change over time. Attitude strength is conceptualized in terms of the connectivity of attitude networks and we show that this provides a parsimonious account of the differences between strong and weak attitudes. We discuss the CAN model in relation to possible extensions, implication for the assessment of attitudes, and possibilities for further study.

@article{dandekarBiasedAssimilationHomophily2013,
	abstract = {We study the issue of polarization in society through a model of opinion formation. We say an opinion formation process is polarizing if it results in increased divergence of opinions. Empirical studies have shown that homophily, i.e., greater interaction between like-minded individuals, results in polarization. However, we show that DeGroot's well-known model of opinion formation based on repeated averaging can never be polarizing, even if individuals are arbitrarily homophilous. We generalize DeGroot's model to account for a phenomenon well known in social psychology as biased assimilation: When presented with mixed or inconclusive evidence on a complex issue, individuals draw undue support for their initial position, thereby arriving at a more extreme opinion. We show that in a simple model of homophilous networks, our biased opinion formation process results in polarization if individuals are sufficiently biased. In other words, homophily alone, without biased assimilation, is not sufficient to polarize society. Quite interestingly, biased assimilation also provides a framework to analyze the polarizing effect of Internet-based recommender systems that show us personalized content.},

Reporting little evidence of mass polarization, previous studies assume polarization is evidenced via the amplification of existing political alignments. This article considers a different pathway: polarization occurring via social, cultural, and political alignments coming to encompass an increasingly diverse array of opinions and attitudes. The study uses 44 years of data from the General Social Survey representing opinions and attitudes across a wide array of domains as elements in an evolving belief network. Analyses of this network produce evidence that mass polarization has increased via a process of belief consolidation, entailing the collapse of previously cross-cutting alignments, thus creating increasingly broad and encompassing clusters organized around cohesive packages of beliefs. Further, the increasing salience of political ideology and partisanship only partly explains this trend.

We here show proof of principle for a conceptualization of sleep stages as attractor states in a nonlinear dynamical system in order to develop new empirical criteria for sleep stages. Methods EEG (single channel) of two healthy sleeping participants was used to demonstrate this conceptualization. Firstly, distinct EEG epochs were selected, both detected by a MLR classifier and through manual scoring. Secondly, change point analysis was used to identify abrupt changes in the EEG signal. Thirdly, these detected change points were evaluated on whether they were preceded by early warning signals. Results Multiple change points were identified in the EEG signal, mostly in interplay with N2. The dynamics before these changes revealed, for a part of the change points, indicators of generic early warning signals, characteristic of complex systems (e.g., ecosystems, climate, epileptic seizures, global finance systems). Conclusions The sketched new framework for studying critical transitions in sleep EEG might benefit the understanding of individual and pathological differences in the dynamics of sleep stage transitions. Formalising sleep as a nonlinear dynamical system can be useful for definitions of sleep quality, i.e. stability and accessibility of an equilibrium state, and disrupted sleep, i.e. constant shifting between instable sleep states.},

We propose that excellence emerges out of dynamic networks consisting of idiosyncratic mixtures of interacting components such as genetic endowment, motivation, practice, and coaching. Using computer simulations we demonstrate that the dynamic network model accurately predicts typical properties of excellence reported in the literature, such as the idiosyncratic developmental trajectories leading to excellence and the highly skewed distributions of productivity present in virtually any achievement domain.

@article{desernoHighwaysHappinessAutistic2020,
	abstract = {The network approach to psychological phenomena advances our understanding of the interrelations between autism and well-being. We use the Perceived Causal Relations methodology in order to (i) identify perceived causal pathways in the well-being system, (ii) validate networks based on self-report data, and (iii) quantify and integrate clinical expertise in autism research. Trained clinicians served as raters (N = 29) completing 374 cause-effects ratings of 34 variables on well-being and symptomatology. A subgroup (N = 16) of raters chose intervention targets in the resulting network which we found to match the respective centrality of nodes. Clinicians' perception of causal relations was similar to the interrelatedness found in self-reported client data (N = 323). We present a useful tool for translating clinical expertise into quantitative information enabling future research to integrate this in scientific studies.},

This model exhibits allopatric speciation at the periphery of its range and reinvasion by the descendant species, without postulating the appearance and disappearance of geographic barriers. Thom's celebrated theory of catastrophes implies that it can be safely assumed in this model that any allopatric speciation must arise from the fold catastrophe. The theory also predicts that the morphological variation in the vicinity of the speciation obeys a "square root" law, which in principle can be tested.},

A number of giant artificial networks of this kind have recently been created, which opens a wide field for the study of their topology, evolution, and the complex processes which occur in them. Such networks possess a rich set of scaling properties. A number of them are scale-free and show striking resilience against random breakdowns. In spite of the large sizes of these networks, the distances between most of their vertices are short - a feature known as the 'small-world' effect. We discuss how growing networks self-organize into scale-free structures, and investigate the role of the mechanism of preferential linking. We consider the topological and structural properties of evolving networks, and percolation and disease spread on these networks. We present a number of models demonstrating the main features of evolving networks and discuss current approaches for their simulation and analytical study. Applications of the general results to particular networks in nature are discussed. We demonstrate the generic connections of the network growth processes with the general problems of non-equilibrium physics, econophysics, evolutionary biology, and so on.},

What are the psychological consequences of adopting these theories? We review the current research and find that it answers the first of these questions more thoroughly than the second. Belief in conspiracy theories appears to be driven by motives that can be characterized as epistemic (understanding one's environment), existential (being safe and in control of one's environment), and social (maintaining a positive image of the self and the social group). However, little research has investigated the consequences of conspiracy belief, and to date, this research does not indicate that conspiracy belief fulfills people's motivations. Instead, for many people, conspiracy belief may be more appealing than satisfying. Further research is needed to determine for whom, and under what conditions, conspiracy theories may satisfy key psychological motives. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Our review reveals that sociologists are not only at the center of cutting-edge research that addresses longstanding questions about human behavior but also developing new lines of inquiry about digital spaces as well.

Moreover, these procedures address few of the possible causal structures by which constructs and measures may be related.

We compared those with and without diagnosed depressive disorders (DD+/DD-) and analysed the effects of differences in (a) network connectivity, (b) symptom thresholds, and (c) autoregressive loops (i.e. how strongly specific symptoms predict themselves) on the potential activation of symptoms over time using simulations developed by Cramer and others (2016). The parameters for the simulation (symptom connectivity and symptom threshold) were obtained from Ising models and cross-lagged panel network analyses. Data were from the nationally representative samples (Health 2000\textendash 2011 Study) of 4190 participants measured in 2011 (cross-sectional analyses) and 3201 participants measured in 2000 and 2011 (longitudinal analyses). DD diagnosis was based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and depressive symptoms were self-reported using the 13-item version of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Differences in symptom connectivity between participants with and without DD were not observed, but the mean probability (threshold) of symptom existence in the DD~+~group was higher than in the DD-group (0.41 vs. 0.12). Simulation showed that there are more active symptoms in the DD~+~group after 10~000 time points (means 1.2 vs. 4.6) than in the DD-group. This difference largely disappeared when we used longitudinal networks, including autoregressive loops, in the connectivity matrix. Our results suggest that the differences in symptom thresholds and autoregressive loops may be more important features than symptom connectivity in differentiating people with and without DD.},

While prior publications have tackled the topics of estimating and interpreting such networks, little work has been conducted to check how accurate (i.e., prone to sampling variation) networks are estimated, and how stable (i.e., interpretation remains similar with less observations) inferences from the network structure (such as centrality indices) are. In this tutorial paper, we aim to introduce the reader to this field and tackle the problem of accuracy under sampling variation. We first introduce the current state-of-the-art of network estimation. Second, we provide a rationale why researchers should investigate the accuracy of psychological networks. Third, we describe how bootstrap routines can be used to (A) assess the accuracy of estimated network connections, (B) investigate the stability of centrality indices, and (C) test whether network connections and centrality estimates for different variables differ from each other. We introduce two novel statistical methods: for (B) the correlation stability coefficient, and for (C) the bootstrapped difference test for edge-weights and centrality indices. We conducted and present simulation studies to assess the performance of both methods. Finally, we developed the free R-package bootnet that allows for estimating psychological networks in a generalized framework in addition to the proposed bootstrap methods. We showcase bootnet in a tutorial, accompanied by R syntax, in which we analyze a dataset of 359 women with posttraumatic stress disorder available online.},

In time-series analysis, the GGM can be used to model the residual structure of a vector-autoregression analysis (VAR), also termed graphical VAR. Two network models can then be obtained: a temporal network and a contemporaneous network. When analyzing data from multiple subjects, a GGM can also be formed on the covariance structure of stationary means\textemdash the between-subjects network. We discuss the interpretation of these models and propose estimation methods to obtain these networks, which we implement in the R packages graphicalVAR and mlVAR.

@article{epskampGeneralizedNetworkPsychometrics2017,
	abstract = {We introduce the network model as a formal psychometric model, conceptualizing the covariance between psychometric indicators as resulting from pairwise interactions between observable variables in a network structure. This contrasts with standard psychometric models, in which the covariance between test items arises from the influence of one or more common latent variables. Here, we present two generalizations of the network model that encompass latent variable structures, establishing network modeling as parts of the more general framework of structural equation modeling (SEM). In the first generalization, we model the covariance structure of latent variables as a network. We term this framework latent network modeling (LNM) and show that, with LNM, a unique structure of conditional independence relationships between latent variables can be obtained in an explorative manner. In the second generalization, the residual variance\textendash covariance structure of indicators is modeled as a network. We term this generalization residual network modeling (RNM) and show that, within this framework, identifiable models can be obtained in which local independence is structurally violated. These generalizations allow for a general modeling framework that can be used to fit, and compare, SEM models, network models, and the RNM and LNM generalizations. This methodology has been implemented in the free-to-use software package lvnet, which contains confirmatory model testing as well as two exploratory search algorithms: stepwise search algorithms for low-dimensional datasets and penalized maximum likelihood estimation for larger datasets. We show in simulation studies that these search algorithms perform adequately in identifying the structure of the relevant residual or latent networks. We further demonstrate the utility of these generalizations in an empirical example on a personality inventory dataset.},

Here, we empirically examine, the stability of and transitions between three substance use states: zero-use, moderate use, and heavy use. We investigate two large datasets from the US and the Netherlands on yearly usage and change of alcohol, nicotine, and cannabis. Results, which we make available through an extensive interactive tool, suggests that there are stable moderate use states, even after meeting criteria for a positive diagnosis of substance abuse or dependency, for both alcohol and cannabis use. Moderate use of tobacco, however, was rare. We discuss implications of recognizing three states rather than two states as a modeling target, in which the moderate use state can both act as an intervention target or as a gateway between zero use and heavy use.},

For instance, a correlation matrix can be represented as a network in which each variable is a node and each correlation an edge; by varying the width of the edges according to the magnitude of the correlation, the structure of the correlation matrix can be visualized. A wide variety of matrices that are used in statistics can be represented in this fashion, for example matrices that contain (implied) covariances, factor loadings, regression parameters and p values. qgraph can also be used as a psychometric tool, as it performs exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, using sem and lavaan; the output of these packages is automatically visualized in qgraph, which may aid the interpretation of results.

This software individual, or "agent," is endowed with distinct emotional/affective, cognitive/deliberative, and social modules. Grounded in contemporary neuroscience, these internal components interact to generate observed, often far-from-rational, individual behavior. When multiple agents of this new type move and interact spatially, they collectively generate an astonishing range of dynamics spanning the fields of social conflict, psychology, public health, law, network science, and economics.Epstein weaves a computational tapestry with threads from Plato, Hume, Darwin, Pavlov, Smith, Tolstoy, Marx, James, and Dostoevsky, among others. This transformative synthesis of social philosophy, cognitive neuroscience, and agent-based modeling will fascinate scholars and students of every stripe. Epstein's computer programs are provided in the book or on its Princeton University Press website, along with movies of his "computational parables.?Agent\_Zero is a signal departure in what it includes (e.g., a new synthesis of neurally grounded internal modules), what it eschews (e.g., standard behavioral imitation), the phenomena it generates (from genocide to financial panic), and the modeling arsenal it offers the scientific community. For generative social science, Agent\_Zero presents a groundbreaking vision and the tools to realize it.},

In Generative Social Science, Joshua Epstein argues that this powerful, novel technique permits the social sciences to meet a fundamentally new standard of explanation, in which one "grows" the phenomenon of interest in an artificial society of interacting agents: heterogeneous, boundedly rational actors, represented as mathematical or software objects. After elaborating this notion of generative explanation in a pair of overarching foundational chapters, Epstein illustrates it with examples chosen from such far-flung fields as archaeology, civil conflict, the evolution of norms, epidemiology, retirement economics, spatial games, and organizational adaptation. In elegant chapter preludes, he explains how these widely diverse modeling studies support his sweeping case for generative explanation. This book represents a powerful consolidation of Epstein's interdisciplinary research activities in the decade since the publication of his and Robert Axtell's landmark volume, Growing Artificial Societies. Beautifully illustrated, Generative Social Science includes a CD that contains animated movies of core model runs, and programs allowing users to easily change assumptions and explore models, making it an invaluable text for courses in modeling at all levels.},

We believe that this assessment still holds, as also evidenced by increasingly common claims that psychology is facing a ``theory crisis'' and that psychologists should invest more in theory building. In this article, we argue that the root cause of the theory crisis is that developing good psychological theories is extremely difficult and that understanding the reasons why it is so difficult is crucial for moving forward in the theory crisis. We discuss three key reasons based on philosophy of science for why developing good psychological theories is so hard: the relative lack of robust phenomena that impose constraints on possible theories, problems of validity of psychological constructs, and obstacles to discovering causal relationships between psychological variables. We conclude with recommendations on how to move past the theory crisis.},

@article{favelaReasoningContinuousLandscapes2019,
	abstract = {Dual-processing theories of reasoning have gained renewed attention in recent years, particularly in the fields of decision-making under uncertainty, learning, and social judgment. Although the various accounts differ, the common thread is the distinction between two qualitatively different reasoning processes, such as automatic/controlled, fast/slow, and unconscious/conscious. Accordingly, much research is focused on elucidating the nature of the two processes in terms of the kinds of information they process and respond to. Less extensive are attempts to identify mediators that underlie changes between the two reasoning strategies. We argue that nonlinear dynamical systems theory may be able to provide a fresh perspective on reasoning. Nonlinear dynamical systems theory allows us to shift the perspective to the dynamic interactions and transitions among continuous yet qualitatively different reasoning processes. We apply the approach to reasoning in decision-making and judgment under uncertainty. Our primary claim is that using different reasoning strategies is better understood as phase transitions among a landscape of continuous reasoning capacities.},

We study the equilibrium phase diagram and the non-equilibrium stochastic dynamics of the model with various analytical approaches and with Monte Carlo simulations on different substrates: the fully-connected (FC) graph, the one-dimensional (1D) chain, and Erd\textbackslash "os-R\textbackslash 'enyi (ER) random graphs. We show that, in the mean-field approximation, the phase boundary between the disordered and polarized phases is characterized by a tricritical point. On the FC graph, in the absence of social agitation, kinetic barriers prevent the system from reaching optimal consensus. On the 1D chain, the main result is that the dynamics is governed by the growth of opinion clusters. Finally, for the ER ensemble a phase transition analogous to that of the FC graph takes place, but now the system is able to reach optimal consensus at low temperatures, except when the average connectivity is low, in which case dynamical traps arise from local frozen configurations.},

Here I propose that we can gain traction on downward causation by being operational and examining how adaptive systems identify regularities in evolutionary or learning time and use these regularities to guide behaviour. I suggest that in many adaptive systems components collectively compute their macroscopic worlds through coarse-graining. I further suggest we move from simple feedback to downward causation when components tune behaviour in response to estimates of collectively computed macroscopic properties. I introduce a weak and strong notion of downward causation and discuss the role the strong form plays in the origins of new organizational levels. I illustrate these points with examples from the study of biological and social systems and deep neural networks. This article is part of the themed issue `Reconceptualizing the origins of life'.},

@article{forbesEvidenceThatPsychopathology2017,
	abstract = {Network analysis is quickly gaining popularity in psychopathology research as a method that aims to reveal causal relationships among individual symptoms. To date, 4 main types of psychopathology networks have been proposed: (a) association networks, (b) regularized concentration networks, (c) relative importance networks, and (d) directed acyclic graphs. The authors examined the replicability of these analyses based on symptoms of major depression and generalized anxiety between and within 2 highly similar epidemiological samples (i.e., the National Comorbidity Survey\textemdash Replication [n = 9282] and the National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing [n = 8841]). Although association networks were stable, the 3 other types of network analysis (i.e., the conditional independence networks) had poor replicability between and within methods and samples. The detailed aspects of the models\textemdash such as the estimation of specific edges and the centrality of individual nodes\textemdash were particularly unstable. For example, 44\% of the symptoms were estimated as the ``most influential'' on at least 1 centrality index across the 6 conditional independence networks in the full samples, and only 13\textendash 21\% of the edges were consistently estimated across these networks. One of the likely reasons for the instability of the networks is the predominance of measurement error in the assessment of individual symptoms. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for the growing field of psychopathology network research, and conclude that novel results originating from psychopathology networks should be held to higher standards of evidence before they are ready for dissemination or implementation in the field.

@article{franzArePsychologicalAttributes2022,
	abstract = {Critics of psychological measurement have accused quantitative psychologists of ignoring the empirical hypothesis that psychological phenomena are quantitative (Michell), or have claimed that it is impossible in principle to find out whether psychological phenomena are actually quantitative (Trendler). By drawing on Bennett and Hacker (2003), I argue that both criticisms do not go far enough because they sidestep the fundamental conceptual problem of the measurement debate: It is impossible to give concrete formulations of the question ``Are psychological attributes quantitative?'' without transgressing the boundaries of meaningful language. Conceptual confusions and questionable philosophical assumptions have contributed to the misguided idea that the quantity of psychological phenomena must or can be demonstrated empirically. First, the measurement debate is characterized by misleading examples and ambiguous terminology. Second, the idea of psychological measurement is inherently Cartesian. In summary, psychological measurement is even more problematic than Michell and Trendler have argued.},

Now is an excellent moment to take stock of the network approach: What are its most fundamental challenges, and what are potential ways forward in addressing them? After a brief conceptual introduction, we first discuss challenges to network theory: (1) What is the validity of the network approach beyond some commonly investigated disorders such as major depression? (2) How do we best define psychopathological networks and their constituent elements? And (3) how can we gain a better understanding of the causal nature and real-life underpinnings of associations among symptoms? Next, after a short technical introduction to network modeling, we discuss challenges to network methodology: (4) heterogeneity of samples studied with network analytic models, and (5) a lurking replicability crisis in this strongly data-driven and exploratory field. Addressing these challenges may propel the network approach from its adolescence into adulthood and promises advances in understanding psychopathology both at the nomothetic and idiographic level.},

@article{friedWhatAreGood2016,
	abstract = {Background The symptoms for Major Depression (MD) defined in the DSM-5 differ markedly from symptoms assessed in common rating scales, and the empirical question about core depression symptoms is unresolved. Here we conceptualize depression as a complex dynamic system of interacting symptoms to examine what symptoms are most central to driving depressive processes. Methods We constructed a network of 28 depression symptoms assessed via the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-30) in 3,463 depressed outpatients from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study. We estimated the centrality of all IDS-30 symptoms, and compared the centrality of DSM and non-DSM symptoms; centrality reflects the connectedness of each symptom with all other symptoms. Results A network with 28 intertwined symptoms emerged, and symptoms differed substantially in their centrality values. Both DSM symptoms (e.g., sad mood) and non-DSM symptoms (e.g., anxiety) were among the most central symptoms, and DSM criteria were not more central than non-DSM symptoms. Limitations Many subjects enrolled in STAR*D reported comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions which may have affected symptom presentation. Conclusion The network perspective neither supports the standard psychometric notion that depression symptoms are equivalent indicators of MD, nor the common assumption that DSM symptoms of depression are of higher clinical relevance than non-DSM depression symptoms. The findings suggest the value of research focusing on especially central symptoms to increase the accuracy of predicting outcomes such as the course of illness, probability of relapse, and treatment response.},

@article{furstenauSimulatingBistablePerception2014,
	abstract = {A behavioral stochastic self-oscillator model is used for simulating interrupted ambiguous stimulus-induced percept reversals. The results provide further support for a dynamical systems foundation of cognitive and psychological problems as discussed in detail within the context of Gestalt psychology by Wagemans et al. (Concept Theor Found Psychol Bull 138(6):1218\textendash 1252, 2012), and for coordination dynamics of the brain (Kelso in Philos Trans R Soc B 367:906\textendash 918, 2012). Statistical evaluation of simulated reversal time series predicts a maximum of the percept reversal rate that conforms with a number of results in the literature. The macroscopic model is based on two inhibitorily coupled sets of three coupled nonlinear equations, one triplet for each percept. The derivation of our specific dynamics equations is based on a drastically simplified field theoretical approach using well-known phase synchronization for explaining brain dynamics on the macroscopic EEG level. The degree of coherence (contrast {$\mu$}, 0~{$\leq~\mu~\leq~$}1) of the superimposed fields required for onset of bistable dynamics is related to a phase synchronization index of EEG fields, and it is used in the present context as ambiguity control parameter. For quantitative agreement with the experimental data, the addition of a stochastic Langevin force term in the attention equation proved essential. Formal analysis leads to a quantification of well-known ``cognitive inertia'' and supports the interplay between percept choice (bifurcation) dynamics during stimulus onset and adaptive gain (attention fatigue) driven quasiperiodic percept reversals.},

@article{galamSociophysicsNewApproach1982,
	abstract = {A new approach to the understanding of sociological collective behaviour, based on the framework of critical phenomena in physics, is presented. The first step consists of constructing a simple mean-behaviour model and applying it to a strike process in a plant. The model comprises only a limited number of parameters characteristic of the plant considered and of the society. A dissatisfaction function is introduced with a basic principle stating that the stable state of the plant is a state which minimizes this function. It is found that the plant can be in one of two phases: the ``collective phase'' and the ``individual phase.'' These two phases are separated by a critical point, in the neighbourhood of which the system is very sensitive to small changes in the parameters. The collective phase includes a region of parameters for which the system has two possible states: a ``work state'' and a ``strike state.'' The actual state of the system depends on the parameters and on the ``history of the system.'' The irreversibility of the transition between these two states indicates the existence of metastable states. For these particular states, the effect of small groups of workers or of a small perturbation in the system results in drastic changes in the state of the plant. Other non-trivial implications of the model, as well as possible extensions and refinements of the approach, are discussed.},

We demonstrate that these model parameters can be constrained by empirical measurement, and the resulting models can be used to investigate the mechanisms underlying belief dynamics in actual societies. We use data from two longitudinal studies of belief change, one on 80~individuals living in an MIT dorm during the 2008 presidential election season, and another on 94~participants recruited from Mechanical Turk during the 2016 presidential election primary season.

@article{gartnerThirdComponentCausing1990,
	abstract = {This paper is a review of experiments, performed in our laboratory during the past 20 years, designed to analyse the significance of different components of random variability in quantitative traits in laboratory rats and mice. Reduction of genetic variability by using inbred strains and reduction of environmental variability by highly standardized husbandry in laboratory animals did not remarkably reduce the range of random variability in quantitative biological traits. Neither did a tremendous increase of the environmental variability (i.e., living in a natural setting) increase it. Therefore, the postnatal environment cannot be that important as the source of random variability.Utilizing methods established in twin research, only 20?30\% of the range of the body weight in inbred mice were directly estimated to be of environmental origin. The remaining 70?80\% were due to a third component creating biological random variability, in addition to the genetic and environmental influences. This third component is effective at or before fertilization and may originate from ooplasmic differences. It is the most important component of the phenotypic random variability, fixing its range and dominating the genetic and the environmental component.The Gaussian distribution of the body weights observed, even in inbred animals, seems to be an arrangement supporting natural selection rather than the consequence of heterogeneous environmental influences. In a group of inbred rats, the males with the highest chance of parenting the next generation were gathered in the central classes of the distribution of the body weight.},

A measure of segregation based on cluster geometry is defined and several quantities analogous to those used to describe physical lattice models at equilibrium are introduced. This physical approach allows to distinguish quantitatively several regimes and to characterize the transitions between them, leading to the building of a phase diagram. Some of the transitions evoke empirical sudden ethnic turnovers. We also establish links with `spin-1' models in physics.

@inproceedings{gell-mannWhatComplexity2002,
	abstract = {It would require many different concepts to capture all our notions of the meaning of complexity. The concept that comes closest to what we usually mean is effective complexity (EC). Roughly speaking, the EC of an entity is the length of a very concise description of its regularities. A novel is considered complex if it has a great many scenes, subplots, characters, and so forth. An elaborate hierarchy can contribute to complexity, as in the case of nested industrial clusters each composed of a great variety of firms and other institutions. In general, though, what are regularities? We encounter in many different situations the interplay between the regular and the random or incidental: music and static on the radio, specifications and tolerances in manufacturing, etc. But ultimately the distinction between the regular and the incidental depends on a judgment of what is important, although the judge need not be human or even alive. For instance, in the case of songs of a male bird in the nesting season, the identification of regularities is perhaps best left to the other birds of the same species \textemdash{} what features are essential in repelling other males from the territory or attracting a suitable female? A technical definition of EC involves the quantity called algorithmic information content (AIC). The description of an entity is converted to a bit string and a standard universal computer is programmed to print out that string and then halt. The length of the shortest such program (or, in a generalization, the shortest that executes within a given time) is the AIC. The AIC is expressed as the sum of two terms, one (the EC) referring to the regularities and the other to the random features. The regularities of a real entity are best expressed by embedding it conceptually in a set of comparable things, the rest of which are imagined. The EC can then be related to the AIC of the set, the choice of which is restricted by the conditions imposed by the judge. Theorists like to study highly simplified models of complex systems, often by computer modelling. What can be claimed for such models? Overall agreement with observation is hardly to be expected. However, in many cases simple regularities can be found in both the observational data and the model, which may then be helpful in understanding those regularities. Examples are given, involving scaling laws and also ``implicational scales''.},

The basic assumption is that vision depends on the eye which is connected to the brain. The author suggests that natural vision depends on the eyes in the head on a body supported by the ground, the brain being only the central organ of a complete visual system. When no constraints are put on the visual system, people look around, walk up to something interesting and move around it so as to see it from all sides, and go from one vista to another. That is natural vision -- and what this book is about.},

@article{guastelloModeratorRegressionCusp1982,
	abstract = {This article demonstrates the applicability of the cusp catastrophe model to a two-stage validity study for personnel selection which can simultaneously assess the success of a training program. Personnel selection is of interest substantively since its literature spans psychology, education, economics, management science, political philosophy, statistics, and psychometric theory. The basic problem is, in turn, pertinent to the study of any individuals integrating into an organization, or a therapy or social program. In an empirical example regression coefficients for conventional and cusp-difference models were compared using partially real and partially simulated data. Subjects were 272 salespersons from a Midwestern firm, of which 17 were Spanish-speaking Americans. Group membership was the dummy coded bifurcation (moderator) factor. A composite of personality and ability test scores was the asymmetry factor. The cusp model was a more efficient predictor of performance (R2 = .39) than the moderator model (R2 = .04) or a control equation using a bimodal transformation (R2 = .04). It was also possible to obtain implicit discriminant functions (IDFS) to predict the top performing 16\% of the sample (R2 = .71), and the low performing 16\% (R2 = .95). The results were interpreted as supporting the usefulness of the statistical catastrophe models for two-stage personnel selection and training, and similar problems. Differential impact, moderator, and interaction effects in organizational literature were discussed vis-\'a-vis the bifurcation concept.},

	abstract = {A broad theory of research methodology for psychology and the behavioral sciences that offers a coherent treatment of a range of behavioral research methods.This book considers scientific method in the behavioral sciences, with particular reference to psychology. Psychologists learn about research methods and use them to conduct their research, but their training teaches them little about the nature of scientific method itself. In Investigating the Psychological World, Brian Haig fills this gap. Drawing on behavioral science methodology, the philosophy of science, and statistical theory, Haig constructs a broad theory of scientific method that has particular relevance for the behavioral sciences. He terms this account of method the abductive theory of method (ATOM) in recognition of the importance it assigns to explanatory reasoning. ATOM offers the framework for a coherent treatment of a range of quantitative and qualitative behavioral research methods, giving equal treatment to data-analytic methods and methods of theory construction.Haig draws on the new experimentalism in the philosophy of science to reconstruct the process of phenomena detection as it applies to psychology; he considers the logic and purpose of exploratory factor analysis; he discusses analogical modeling as a means of theory development; and he recommends the use of inference to the best explanation for evaluating theories in psychology. Finally, he outlines the nature of research problems, discusses the nature of the abductive method, and describes applications of the method to grounded theory method and clinical reasoning. The book will be of interest not only to philosophers of science but also to psychological researchers who want to deepen their conceptual understanding of research methods and methodological concerns.},

It focusses its attention on those situations where systems change their behavior qualitatively. The basic concepts of synergetics, such as stability and instability, order parameters, control parameters, the slaving principle, hysteresis, critical fluctuations, etc. are illustrated by means of examples taken from physics (lasers and fluid dynamics) and physiology (finger movements). It is shown how the concepts of synergetics may be used as metaphors at the conceptual level, but that they allow us also to devise computer models for phenomena treated by psychology, e.g. visual perception, including those of ambiguous pictures, where contact with Gestalt theory can also be made. As is shown in particular, the change of rather unspecific control parameters can induce a qualitative change in the behavior of a system.},

Beyond a critical frequency the originally prepared out-of-phase, antisymmetric mode is replaced by a symmetrical, in-phase mode involving simultaneous activation of homologous muscle groups. Qualitavely, these phase transitions are analogous to gait shifts in animal locomotion as well as phenomena common to other physical and biological systems in which new ``modes'' or spatiotemporal patterns arise when the system is parametrically scaled beyond its equilibrium state (Haken, 1983).

These four methods are (1) approximating the diffusion process by a random walk with very small time steps; (2) drawing directly from the joint density of responses and reaction time by means of a (possibly) repeated application of a rejection algorithm; (3) using a discrete approximation to the stochastic differential equation describing the diffusion process; and (4) a probability integral transform method approximating the inverse of the cumulative distribution function of the diffusion process. The four methods for simulating response probabilities and response times are compared on two criteria: simulation speed and accuracy of the simulation. It is concluded that the rejection-based and probability integral transform method perform best on both criteria, and that the stochastic differential approximation is worst. An important drawback of the rejection method is that it is applicable only to the Wiener process, whereas the probability integral transform method is more general.},

@article{hameroffOrchestratedReductionQuantum1996,
	abstract = {Features of consciousness difficult to understand in terms of conventional neuroscience have evoked application of quantum theory, which describes the fundamental behavior of matter and energy. In this paper we propose that aspects of quantum theory (e.g. quantum coherence) and of a newly proposed physical phenomenon of quantum wave function ``self-collapse'' (objective reduction: OR - Penrose, 1994) are essential for consciousness, and occur in cytoskeletal microtubules and other structures within each of the brain's neurons. The particular characteristics of microtubules suitable for quantum effects include their crystal-like lattice structure, hollow inner core, organization of cell function and capacity for information processing. We envisage that conformational states of microtubule subunits (tubulins) are coupled to internal quantum events, and cooperatively interact (compute) with other tubulins. We further assume that macroscopic coherent superposition of quantum-coupled tubulin conformational states occurs throughout significant brain volumes and provides the global binding essential to consciousness. We equate the emergence of the microtubule quantum coherence with pre-conscious processing which grows (for up to 500 ms) until the mass-energy difference among the separated states of tubulins reaches a threshold related to quantum gravity. According to the arguments for OR put forth in Penrose (1994), superpositioned states each have their own space-time geometries. When the degree of coherent mass-energy difference leads to sufficient separation of space-time geometry, the system must choose and decay (reduce, collapse) to a single universe state. In this way, a transient superposition of slightly differing space-time geometries persists until an abrupt quantum \textrightarrow{} classical reduction occurs. Unlike the random, ``subjective reduction'' (SR, or R) of standard quantum theory caused by observation or environmental entanglement, the OR we propose in microtubules is a self-collapse and it results in particular patterns of microtubule-tubulin conformational states that regulate neuronal activities including synaptic functions. Possibilities and probabilities for post-reduction tubulin states are influenced by factors including attachments of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) acting as ``nodes'' which tune and ``orchestrate'' the quantum oscillations. We thus term the self-tuning OR process in microtubules ``orchestrated objective reduction'' (``Orch OR''), and calculate an estimate for the number of tubulins (and neurons) whose coherence for relevant time periods (e.g. 500 ms) will elicit Orch OR. In providing a connection among (1) pre-conscious to conscious transition, (2) fundamental space-time notions, (3) non-computability, and (4) binding of various (time scale and spatial) reductions into an instantaneous event (``conscious now''), we believe Orch OR in brain microtubules is the most specific and plausible model for consciousness yet proposed.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, there has been a surge of empirical research investigating mental disorders as complex systems. In this article, we investigate how to best make use of this growing body of empirical research and move the field toward its fundamental aims of explaining, predicting, and controlling psychopathology. We first review the contemporary philosophy of science literature on scientific theories and argue that fully achieving the aims of explanation, prediction, and control requires that we construct formal theories of mental disorders: theories expressed in the language of mathematics or a computational programming language. We then investigate three routes by which one can use empirical findings (i.e., data models) to construct formal theories: (a) using data models themselves as formal theories, (b) using data models to infer formal theories, and (c) comparing empirical data models to theory-implied data models in order to evaluate and refine an existing formal theory. We argue that the third approach is the most promising path forward. We conclude by introducing the abductive formal theory construction (AFTC) framework, informed by both our review of philosophy of science and our methodological investigation. We argue that this approach provides a clear and promising way forward for using empirical research to inform the generation, development, and testing of formal theories both in the domain of psychopathology and in the broader field of psychological science.

To gain theoretical understanding of these dynamics, we need to make inferences from time series models about the underlying system. Such inferences are subject to two challenges: first, time series models will arguably always be misspecified, meaning it is unclear how to make inferences to the underlying system; and second, the sampling frequency must be sufficient to capture the dynamics of interest. We discuss both problems with the following approach: we specify a toy model for emotion dynamics as the true system, generate time series data from it, and then try to recover that system with the most popular time series analysis tools. We show that making straightforward inferences from time series models about an underlying system is difficult. We also show that if the sampling frequency is insufficient, the dynamics of interest cannot be recovered. However, we also show that global characteristics of the system can be recovered reliably. We conclude by discussing the consequences of our findings for idiographic modeling and suggest a modeling methodology that goes beyond fitting time series models alone and puts formal theories at the center of theory development.},

These data are then fitted to a simple, non-linear, density dependent population model. (2) A rich spectrum of dynamical behaviour is possible in such a non-linear model (ranging from a stable equilibrium point, through stable cycles, to apparently chaotic population fluctuations). In the particular model discussed, these stability properties hinge upon two parameters. These have been estimated for a variety of insect populations enabling us to compare the dynamical behaviour of real populations with that which is theoretically possible. (3) We find the majority of populations show a monotonic return to a stable equilibrium point following a disturbance, with relatively few examples of oscillatory damping or low-order limit cycles. (4) Examples of stable cyclic behaviour, or of chaotic fluctuations, are mostly found in laboratory populations. In such cases, the absence of many natural mortality factors, or of dispersal, may tend to exaggerate non-linear aspects of the dynamics. (5) The observed range of fluctuations in various populations is tabulated. These are discussed in relation to the predicted ranges of fluctuation where limit cycles or chaos occur. The conclusion supports that of (3) above; namely that most natural populations will tend to return to a stable equilibrium point following a disturbance.}

	abstract = {Additional Resource Materials Human behavior would not be interesting to us if it remained the same from one moment to the next. Moreover, we tend to be sensitive to changes in people's behavior, especially when such change impacts on our own, and other's, behavior. This book describes a variety of techniques for investigating change in behavior. It employs conventional time series methods, as well as recently developed methodology using nonlinear dynamics, including chaos, a term that is not easy to define, nor to confirm.  Although nonlinear methods are being used more frequently in psychology, a comprehensive coverage of methods, theory and applications, with a particular focus on human behavior, is needed. Between these covers, the reader is led through various procedures for linear and nonlinear time series analysis, including some novel procedures that allow subtle temporal aspects of human cognition to be detected. Analyses of reaction times, heart-rate, psychomotor skill, decision making, and EEG are supplemented by a contemporary review of recent dynamical research in developmental psychology, psychopathology, and human cognitive processes. A consideration of nonlinear dynamics assists our understanding of deep issues such as: Why is our short-term memory capacity limited? Why do chronic disorders, and also cognitive development, progress through stage-like transitions? Why do people make irrational decisions?  This book will be of particular interest to researchers, practitioners, and advanced students in a variety of areas in psychology, particularly in human experimental and physiological psychology. Data analyses are performed using the latest nonlinear dynamics computer packages. A comprehensive WWW resource of software and supplementary information is provided to assist the reader's understanding of the novel, and potentially revolutionary, procedures described in the book.},

	abstract = {It is suggested that the motion of pedestrians can be described as if they would be subject to ``social forces.'' These ``forces'' are not directly exerted by the pedestrians' personal environment, but they are a measure for the internal motivations of the individuals to perform certain actions (movements). The corresponding force concept is discussed in more detail and can also be applied to the description of other behaviors. In the presented model of pedestrian behavior several force terms are essential: first, a term describing the acceleration towards the desired velocity of motion; second, terms reflecting that a pedestrian keeps a certain distance from other pedestrians and borders; and third, a term modeling attractive effects. The resulting equations of motion of nonlinearly coupled Langevin equations. Computer simulations of crowds of interacting pedestrians show that the social force model is capable of describing the self-organization of several observed collective effects of pedestrian behavior very realistically., This article appears in the following collection:},

@article{hendrikseModelingEmergingInterpersonal2023,
	abstract = {When people interact, their behaviour tends to become synchronized, a mutual coordination process that fosters short-term adaptations, like increased affiliation, and long-term adaptations, like increased bonding. This paper addresses for the first time how such short-term and long-term adaptivity induced by synchronization can be modeled computationally by a second-order multi-adaptive neural agent model. It addresses movement, affect and verbal modalities and both intrapersonal synchrony and interpersonal synchrony. The behaviour of the introduced neural agent model was evaluated in a simulation paradigm with different stimuli and communication enabling conditions. Moreover, in this paper, mathematical analysis is also addressed for adaptive network models and their positioning within the landscape of adaptive dynamical systems. The first type of analysis addressed shows that any smooth adaptive dynamical system has a canonical representation by a self-modeling network. This implies theoretically that the self-modeling network format is widely applicable, which also has been found in many practical applications using this approach. Furthermore, stationary point and equilibrium analysis was addressed and applied to the introduced self-modeling network model. It was used to obtain verification of the model providing evidence that the implemented model is correct with respect to its design specifications.},

The principal result is that limit sets of such systems cannot be more complicated than invariant sets of systems of one lower dimension. In fact orthogonal projection along any positive direction maps a limit set homeomorphically and equivariantly onto an invariant set of a Lipschitz vector field in a hyperplane. Limit sets are nowhere dense, unknotted and unlinked. In dimension 2 every trajectory is eventually monotone. In dimension 3 a compact limit set which does not contain an equilibrium is a closed orbit or a cylinder of closed orbits.},

@article{hoelQuantifyingCausalEmergence2013,
	abstract = {Causal interactions within complex systems can be analyzed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. For example, the brain can be analyzed at the level of neurons, neuronal groups, and areas, over tens, hundreds, or thousands of milliseconds. It is widely assumed that, once a micro level is fixed, macro levels are fixed too, a relation called supervenience. It is also assumed that, although macro descriptions may be convenient, only the micro level is causally complete, because it includes every detail, thus leaving no room for causation at the macro level. However, this assumption can only be evaluated under a proper measure of causation. Here, we use a measure [effective information (EI)] that depends on both the effectiveness of a system's mechanisms and the size of its state space: EI is higher the more the mechanisms constrain the system's possible past and future states. By measuring EI at micro and macro levels in simple systems whose micro mechanisms are fixed, we show that for certain causal architectures EI can peak at a macro level in space and/or time. This happens when coarse-grained macro mechanisms are more effective (more deterministic and/or less degenerate) than the underlying micro mechanisms, to an extent that overcomes the smaller state space. Thus, although the macro level supervenes upon the micro, it can supersede it causally, leading to genuine causal emergence\textemdash the gain in EI when moving from a micro to a macro level of analysis.},

Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems is the book that initiated this field of study, presenting the theoretical foundations and exploring applications.In its most familiar form, adaptation is a biological process, whereby organisms evolve by rearranging genetic material to survive in environments confronting them. In this now classic work, Holland presents a mathematical model that allows for the nonlinearity of such complex interactions. He demonstrates the model's universality by applying it to economics, physiological psychology, game theory, and artificial intelligence and then outlines the way in which this approach modifies the traditional views of mathematical genetics.Initially applying his concepts to simply defined artificial systems with limited numbers of parameters, Holland goes on to explore their use in the study of a wide range of complex, naturally occuring processes, concentrating on systems having multiple factors that interact in nonlinear ways. Along the way he accounts for major effects of coadaptation and coevolution: the emergence of building blocks, or schemata, that are recombined and passed on to succeeding generations to provide, innovations and improvements.},

@misc{huthBayesianAnalysisCrosssectional2023,
	abstract = {Network psychometrics is a new direction in psychological research that conceptualizes psychological constructs as systems of interacting variables. In network analysis, variables are represented as nodes and their interactions yield (partial) associations. Current estimation methods mostly use a frequentist approach, which does not allow for proper uncertainty quantification of the model and its parameters. Here, we outline a Bayesian approach to network analysis that offers three main benefits. In particular, applied researchers can use Bayesian methods to (1) determine structure uncertainty, (2) obtain evidence for edge inclusion and exclusion (i.e., distinguish conditional (in)dependence between variables), and (3) quantify parameter precision. The paper provides a conceptual introduction to Bayesian inference, describes how researchers can facilitate the three benefits for networks, and reviews the available R packages. In addition, we present two user-friendly software solutions: a new R package easybgm for fitting, extracting, and visualizing the Bayesian analysis of networks, and a graphical user interface implementation in JASP. The methodology is illustrated with a worked-out example of a network of personality traits and mental health.},

In this article, an overview is first provided of the Complex Systems Conceptual Framework for Learning (CSCFL), which consists of a set of conceptual perspectives that are generally shared by educational complex systems, organized into two focus areas: collective behaviors of a system, and behaviors of individual agents in a system. Complexity and research methodologies for education are then considered, and it is observed that commonly used quantitative and qualitative techniques are generally appropriate for studying linear dynamics of educational systems. However, it is proposed that computational modeling approaches, being extensively used for studying nonlinear characteristics of complex systems in other fields, can provide a methodological complement to quantitative and qualitative education research approaches. Two research case studies of this approach are discussed. We conclude with a consideration of how viewing education as a complex system using complex systems' conceptual and methodological tools can help advance education research and also inform policy.},

Results demonstrate that the attitude structure of agents determines the occurrence of assimilation and contrast effects, which in turn cause a group of agents to reach consensus, to bipolarize, or to develop a number of subgroups sharing the same position.

This development has been due to physicists venturing outside of their traditional domains of interest, but also due to scientists from other disciplines taking from physics the methods that have proven so successful throughout the 19th and the 20th century. Here we characterise the field with the term `social physics' and pay our respect to intellectual mavericks who nurtured it to maturity. We do so by reviewing the current state of the art. Starting with a set of topics that are at the heart of modern human societies, we review research dedicated to urban development and traffic, the functioning of financial markets, cooperation as the basis for our evolutionary success, the structure of social networks, and the integration of intelligent machines into these networks. We then shift our attention to a set of topics that explore potential threats to society. These include criminal behaviour, large-scale migration, epidemics, environmental challenges, and climate change. We end the coverage of each topic with promising directions for future research. Based on this, we conclude that the future for social physics is bright. Physicists studying societal phenomena are no longer a curiosity, but rather a force to be reckoned with. Notwithstanding, it remains of the utmost importance that we continue to foster constructive dialogue and mutual respect at the interfaces of different scientific disciplines.},

@article{johnsonModelingMultispeciesPredator2019,
	abstract = {Woodland caribou is a Threatened or Endangered subspecies across much of Canada. In many cases, these caribou are declining because of human-mediated predation in the form of apparent competition. Provincial and federal agencies have employed a number of conservation actions to arrest the decline, but insufficient time and limited replication make it difficult to test the efficacy of those activities. We built a three-species population model that served as a tool to integrate current knowledge, explore uncertainties, and assess activities focused on the recovery of caribou. We applied the model to interconnected populations of caribou, moose, and wolves at two locations in Canada (Chinchaga [British Columbia], Charlevoix [Qu\'ebec]) and explored the efficacy of conservation actions unique to each population: predator control, restoration of linear features, reduction of habitat for moose, supplementation, maternal pens, and predator exclosures. Results confirmed that caribou at these two locations faced different recovery challenges, dictated by specific population dynamics and threats. Wolf predation, enhanced by seismic lines and resource roads, was responsible for the decline of the simulated Chinchaga population. The most cost-effective recovery actions for that population were long-term lethal wolf control ({$\lambda$}1\textendash 50 = 1.014, \$25,665/caribou), a large-scale predator exclosure ({$\lambda$}1\textendash 50 = 1.015, \$170,767/caribou), and the aggressive restoration of linear features ({$\lambda$}1\textendash 50 = 1.002, \$531,675/caribou). In contrast, simulations suggested that calf predation by black bears, a fixed source of mortality in the model, limited the growth of the Charlevoix population. Assuming high survival of adult caribou and poor recruitment of juveniles, a maternal pen was the most effective action for the recovery of those caribou ({$\lambda$}1\textendash 50 = 1.004, \$148,473/caribou). Short-term population supplementation provided only a temporary increase in abundance ({$\lambda$}1\textendash 50 = 0.994, \$62,143/caribou). The model was limited by ecological and data uncertainties, but served as an effective platform for representing and testing our understanding of the complex interspecific interactions that underlie the recovery of woodland caribou.},

@article{jonesBridgeCentralityNetwork2021,
	abstract = {Recently, researchers in clinical psychology have endeavored to create network models of the relationships between symptoms, both within and across mental disorders. Symptoms that connect two mental disorders are called "bridge symptoms." Unfortunately, no formal quantitative methods for identifying these bridge symptoms exist. Accordingly, we developed four network statistics to identify bridge symptoms: bridge strength, bridge betweenness, bridge closeness, and bridge expected influence. These statistics are nonspecific to the type of network estimated, making them potentially useful in individual-level psychometric networks, group-level psychometric networks, and networks outside the field of psychopathology such as social networks. We first tested the fidelity of our statistics in predicting bridge nodes in a series of simulations. Averaged across all conditions, the statistics achieved a sensitivity of 92.7\% and a specificity of 84.9\%. By simulating datasets of varying sample sizes, we tested the robustness of our statistics, confirming their suitability for network psychometrics. Furthermore, we simulated the contagion of one mental disorder to another, showing that deactivating bridge nodes prevents the spread of comorbidity (i.e., one disorder activating another). Eliminating nodes based on bridge statistics was more effective than eliminating nodes high on traditional centrality statistics in preventing comorbidity. Finally, we applied our algorithms to 18 group-level empirical comorbidity networks from published studies and discussed the implications of this analysis.},

In this paper, concerning nine research questions, 180 research papers are studied. In addition to exploring definitions and features of emergence, a variety of research interests has been found, including studies on why and how to identify, measure, validate, predict, model, simulate, and control emergence.Conclusion This study shows that much research had been done not only in computer science but also in other sciences on emergence. In addition to a need to provide new methods, based on various technologies, for identifying, measuring, verifying, modeling, simulating, predicting, and controlling emergence in future research, there is a lack of work regarding many issues on emergence.},

@book{kauffmanOriginsOrderSelfOrganization1993,
	abstract = {Stuart Kauffman here presents a brilliant new paradigm for evolutionary biology, one that extends the basic concepts of Darwinian evolution to accommodate recent findings and perspectives from the fields of biology, physics, chemistry and mathematics. The book drives to the heart of the exciting debate on the origins of life and maintenance of order in complex biological systems. It focuses on the concept of self-organization: the spontaneous emergence of order that is widely observed throughout nature Kauffman argues that self-organization plays an important role in the Darwinian process of natural selection. Yet until now no systematic effort has been made to incorporate the concept of self-organization into evolutionary theory. The construction requirements which permit complex systems to adapt are poorly understood, as is the extent to which selection itself can yield systems able to adapt more successfully. This book explores these themes. It shows how complex systems,contrary to expectations, can spontaneously exhibit stunning degrees of order, and how this order, in turn, is essential for understanding the emergence and development of life on Earth. Topics include the new biotechnology of applied molecular evolution, with its important implications for developing new drugs and vaccines; the balance between order and chaos observed in many naturally occurring systems; new insights concerning the predictive power of statistical mechanics in biology; and other major issues. Indeed, the approaches investigated here may prove to be the new center around which biological science itself will evolve. The work is written for all those interested in the cutting edge of research in the life sciences.},

@book{kelsoDynamicPatternsSelforganization1995,
	abstract = {In this book J. Kelso proposes a . . . general framework within which to connect brain, mind, and behavior.  Kelso's prescription for mental life breaks dramatically with the classical computational approach that is still the operative framework for many newer psychological and neurophysiological studies. His core thesis is that the creation and evolution of patterned behavior at all levels\textemdash from neurons to mind\textemdash is governed by the generic processes of self-organization. Both human brain and behavior are shown to exhibit features of pattern-forming dynamical systems, including multistability, abrupt phase transitions, crises, and intermittency.  "Dynamic Patterns" brings together different aspects of this approach to the study of human behavior, using simple experimental examples and illustrations to convey essential concepts, strategies, and methods, with a minimum of mathematics.  Kelso begins with a general account of dynamic pattern formation. He then takes up behavior, focusing initially on identifying pattern-forming instabilities in human sensorimotor coordination. Moving back and forth between theory and experiment, he establishes the notion that the same pattern-forming mechanisms apply regardless of the component parts involved (parts of the body, parts of the nervous system, parts of society) and the medium through which the parts are coupled. Finally, employing the latest techniques to observe spatiotemporal patterns of brain activity, Kelso shows that the human brain is fundamentally a pattern-forming dynamical system, poised on the brink of instability. Self-organization thus underlies the cooperative action of neurons that produces human behavior in all its forms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The empirical aspects are guided by synergetics, a theory of spontaneous pattern formation in open systems. Following an outline of our theoretical strategy, recent experimental results are reviewed that demonstrate the validity of the approach. From these studies, it is possible to establish the linkage between order-order transitions in movement behavior and other nonequilibrium phase transitions in nature. Behavioral patterns (corresponding to low-dimensional attractors for collective variables) and their dynamics are shown to arise in a purely self-organized fashion from cooperative coupling among individual components. This step has been implemented analytically and computationally. The insights gained from the present research allow a generalization in the form of seven theoretical propositions that aim at characterizing pattern formation, stability and change in complex, biological systems.

Studies have begun to compare these models directly to one another using cognitive ability data, although such a comparison has so far not extended to genetics. Our aim with this study was therefore to compare factor and network models of cognitive abilities first at a phenotypic level and then at a genetic level. We analyzed data from the Twins Early Development Study that were collected using 14 cognitive ability measures from 11,290 twins in the UK aged 12~years old. We conducted phenotypic and genetic analyses in which numerous factor and network models were tested, including a novel network twin model. Factor and network models both provided useful representations of the phenotypic and genetic relationships among cognitive abilities. Surprisingly, several relationships among cognitive abilities within the genetic networks were negative, which suggests that these cognitive abilities might share some genetic variants with inverse effects, although more research is currently needed to confirm this. Implications for future genomic research are discussed.},

Results showed that the ICP and the HICP algorithms perform best in most simulation conditions.

The paper reports four studies based on applying the system of meaning (Kreitler \& Kreitler) to horizontal decalage in conservation. Study 1 (630 first graders, 42 conservation problems) showed that difficulty of conservation problems corresponded to the distance between content aspects in the problems. Study 2 (360 first graders, 12 conservation problems) showed that differences in the performance level in different content domains reflected differences in the children's mastery of these content domains. Study 3 (160 first graders, 36 conservation problems, and the Meaning Questionnaire) identified a set of cognitive processes involved in conservation, and showed that high scorers on these processes solved problems of all degrees of difficulty better than did low scorers. Study 4 (210 first graders, 18 conservation problems, and the Meaning Questionnaire) showed that the mastery of the content domain and the cognitive processes accounted for most of the variance. Main conclusions are that horizontal decalage is a predictable phenomenon determined by the difficulty and content domain, affected by the subject's mastery of the cognitive processes involved in conservation and the relevant content domain, respectively.},

The vase/face picture is one of the most famous examples. In this book scientists from many disciplines including physics, biology, psychology, maths and computer science, present recent progress in this fascinating area of cognitive science. Using the phenomenon of multistability as a paradigm they seek to understand how meaning originates in the brain as a consequence of cognitive processes. New advances are achieved by applying concepts such as self-organization, chaos theory and complex systems to the latest results of psychological and neurophysical experiments.},

@article{kumarSemanticMemoryReview2021,
	abstract = {Adult semantic memory has been traditionally conceptualized as a relatively static memory system that consists of knowledge about the world, concepts, and symbols. Considerable work in the past few decades has challenged this static view of semantic memory, and instead proposed a more fluid and flexible system that is sensitive to context, task demands, and perceptual and sensorimotor information from the environment. This paper (1) reviews traditional and modern computational models of semantic memory, within the umbrella of network (free association-based), feature (property generation norms-based), and distributional semantic (natural language corpora-based) models, (2) discusses the contribution of these models to important debates in the literature regarding knowledge representation (localist vs. distributed representations) and learning (error-free/Hebbian learning vs. error-driven/predictive learning), and (3) evaluates how modern computational models (neural network, retrieval-based, and topic models) are revisiting the traditional ``static'' conceptualization of semantic memory and tackling important challenges in semantic modeling such as addressing temporal, contextual, and attentional influences, as well as incorporating grounding and compositionality into semantic representations. The review also identifies new challenges regarding the abundance and availability of data, the generalization of semantic models to other languages, and the role of social interaction and collaboration in language learning and development. The concluding section advocates the need for integrating representational accounts of semantic memory with process-based accounts of cognitive behavior, as well as the need for explicit comparisons of computational models to human baselines in semantic tasks to adequately assess their psychological plausibility as models of human semantic memory.},

It is commonly implied that there is such a thing as a complex system, different examples of which are studied across many disciplines. However, there is no concise definition of a complex system, let alone a definition on which all scientists agree. We review various attempts to characterize a complex system, and consider a core set of features that are widely associated with complex systems in the literature and by those in the field. We argue that some of these features are neither necessary nor sufficient for complexity, and that some of them are too vague or confused to be of any analytical use. In order to bring mathematical rigour to the issue we then review some standard measures of complexity from the scientific literature, and offer a taxonomy for them, before arguing that the one that best captures the qualitative notion of the order produced by complex systems is that of the Statistical Complexity. Finally, we offer our own list of necessary conditions as a characterization of complexity. These conditions are qualitative and may not be jointly sufficient for complexity. We close with some suggestions for future work.},

This paper presents research on cellular automata which suggests that the optimal conditions for the support of information transmission, storage, and modification, are achieved in the vicinity of a phase transition. We observe surprising similarities between the behaviors of computations and systems near phase transitions, finding analogs of computational complexity classes and the halting problem within the phenomenology of phase transitions. We conclude that there is a fundamental connection between computation and phase transitions, especially second-order or ``critical'' transitions, and discuss some of the implications for our understanding of nature if such a connection is borne out.},

Solutions of these equations can be identified with trajectories in phase space. For those systems with bounded solutions, it is found that nonperiodic solutions are ordinarily unstable with respect to small modifications, so that slightly differing initial states can evolve into considerably different states. Systems with bounded solutions are shown to possess bounded numerical solutions. A simple system representing cellular convection is solved numerically. All of the solutions are found to be unstable, and almost all of them are nonperiodic. The feasibility of very-long-range weather prediction is examined in the light of these results.},

They have raised a fair amount of attention in the communities of social simulation, sociophysics and complexity science. The researchers working on it come from disciplines such as physics, mathematics, computer science, social psychology and philosophy. In these models agents hold continuous opinions which they can gradually adjust if they hear the opinions of others. The idea of bounded confidence is that agents only interact if they are close in opinion to each other. Usually, the models are analyzed with agent-based simulations in a Monte Carlo style, but they can also be reformulated on the agent's density in the opinion space in a master equation style. The contribution of this survey is fourfold. First, it will present the agent-based and density-based modeling frameworks including the cases of multidimensional opinions and heterogeneous bounds of confidence. Second, it will give the bifurcation diagrams of cluster configuration in the homogeneous model with uniformly distributed initial opinions. Third, it will review the several extensions and the evolving phenomena which have been studied so far, and fourth it will state some open questions.},

@article{loweryBalancingActPerformance2021,
	abstract = {Organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) and counterproductive work behaviors (CWBs) are recognized as two primary dimensions of the job performance domain, each contributing to crucial individual and organizational outcomes. However, an incomplete understanding of the OCB-CWB interplay persists due to a predominant focus on their between-person interrelation and a lack of consistent empirical support for the few within-person OCB-CWB studies. Here we elucidate the dynamic OCB-CWB interplay by integrating moral licensing and moral cleansing theories to form an overarching framework that explains previous inconsistency in findings. Specifically, we argue that performing OCBs can lead individuals to perceive a license to perform subsequent CWBs, whereas performing CWBs can lead individuals to compensate for their undesirable behavior by performing OCBs. In a 10-day daily-diary survey, we utilize the cutting-edge technique of directed-graph psychometric network analysis to test our hypotheses. Results suggest that although there may be a negative or null OCB-CWB relationship due to individuals' general consistency in behavior, integrating moral licensing and cleansing can explain instances of positive relations wherein OCBs predict subsequent CWBs and vice versa. Our findings demonstrate distinct relations at the between- and within-person levels of this phenomenon, as well as individual differences in the specific behavioral patterning of the OCB-CWB interplay. Notably, the current findings constitute a contribution to both our theoretical understanding of the dynamic OCB-CWB interplay, an empirical test of two major theories of moral behavior applied to the workplace, and points to the practical potential of the psychometric network approach within research and practice.},

@article{lunanskyInterveningPsychopathologyNetworks2022,
	abstract = {Identifying the different influences of symptoms in dynamic psychopathology models may hold promise for increasing treatment efficacy in clinical applications. Dynamic psychopathology models study the behavioral patterns of symptom networks, where symptoms mutually enforce each other. Interventions could be tailored to specific symptoms that are most effective at lowering symptom activity or that hinder the further development of psychopathology. Simulating interventions in psychopathology network models fits in a novel tradition where symptom-specific perturbations are used as in silico interventions. Here, we present the NodeIdentifyR algorithm (NIRA) to identify the projected most efficient, symptom-specific intervention target in a network model (i.e., the Ising model). We implemented NIRA in a freely available R package. The technique studies the projected effects of symptom-specific interventions by simulating data while symptom parameters (i.e., thresholds) are systematically altered. The projected effect of these interventions is defined in terms of the expected change in overall symptom activity across simulations. With this algorithm, it is possible to study (1) whether symptoms differ in their projected influence on the behavior of the symptom network and, if so, (2) which symptom has the largest projected effect in lowering or increasing overall symptom activation. As an illustration, we apply the algorithm to an empirical dataset containing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder symptom assessments of participants who experienced the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008. The most important limitations of the method are discussed, as well as recommendations for future research, such as shifting towards modeling individual processes to validate these types of simulation-based intervention methods.},

@article{luppiSynergisticCoreHuman2022,
	abstract = {How does the organization of neural information processing enable humans' sophisticated cognition? Here we decompose functional interactions between brain regions into synergistic and redundant components, revealing their distinct information-processing roles. Combining functional and structural neuroimaging with meta-analytic results, we demonstrate that redundant interactions are predominantly associated with structurally coupled, modular sensorimotor processing. Synergistic interactions instead support integrative processes and complex cognition across higher-order brain networks. The human brain leverages synergistic information to a greater extent than nonhuman primates, with high-synergy association cortices exhibiting the highest degree of evolutionary cortical expansion. Synaptic density mapping from positron emission tomography and convergent molecular and metabolic evidence demonstrate that synergistic interactions are supported by receptor diversity and human-accelerated genes underpinning synaptic function. This information-resolved approach provides analytic tools to disentangle information integration from coupling, enabling richer, more accurate interpretations of functional connectivity, and illuminating how the human neurocognitive architecture navigates the trade-off between robustness and integration.},

	abstract = {The brain is a complex, multiscale dynamical system composed of many interacting regions. Knowledge of the spatiotemporal organization of these interactions is critical for establishing a solid understanding of the brain's functional architecture and the relationship between neural dynamics and cognition in health and disease. The possibility of studying these dynamics through careful analysis of neuroimaging data has catalyzed substantial interest in methods that estimate time-resolved fluctuations in functional connectivity (often referred to as ``dynamic'' or time-varying functional connectivity; TVFC). At the same time, debates have emerged regarding the application of TVFC analyses to resting fMRI data, and about the statistical validity, physiological origins, and cognitive and behavioral relevance of resting TVFC. These and other unresolved issues complicate interpretation of resting TVFC findings and limit the insights that can be gained from this promising new research area. This article brings together scientists with a variety of perspectives on resting TVFC to review the current literature in light of these issues. We introduce core concepts, define key terms, summarize controversies and open questions, and present a forward-looking perspective on how resting TVFC analyses can be rigorously and productively applied to investigate a wide range of questions in cognitive and systems neuroscience.},

Three sets of models were tested using data from a 12 month longitudinal study of adolescent smoking in Australia: the first with peer pressure only as the bifurcation term, the second with behavioural intention only and the third with both. In isolation both bifurcation variables performed similarly (adjusted-R{$^2$} and beta). In the third model, peer pressure edged out behavioural intention as an indicator of catastrophic change. Post hoc analysis revealed the polynomial and simple terms of initial conditions were more important than the bifurcation variable to explain change in smoking behaviour. This provoked a call for more work on finding an appropriately complex (non-straight line), theoretically justifiable mathematical model of adolescent substance use. Overall, behavioural intention was considered equivalent to peer pressure as a bifurcation variable although further research is needed to confirm this result.

	abstract = {Parallel distributed processing provides a new way of thinking about perception, memory, learning, and thinking\textemdash and about basic computational mechanisms for intelligent information processing in general. These new ways of thinking have all been captured in simulation models. Our own understanding of parallel distributed processing (PDP) has come about largely through hands-on experimentation with these models. And, in teaching PDP to others, we have discovered that their understanding is enhanced through the same kind of hands-on simulation experience. This handicap is intended to help a wider audience gain this kind of experience. It makes many of the simulation models discussed in the two PDP volumes (McClelland, Rumelhart, \& the PDP Research Group, 1986; Rumelhart, McClelland, \& the PDP Research Group, 1986) available in a form that is both accessible and easy to use. The handbook also provides what we hope are relatively accessible expositions of some of the main mathematical results that underlie the simulation models. And it provides a number of prepared exercises to help the reader begin exploring the simulation programs. This handbook is intended for use in conjunction with the two PDP volumes, particularly for users new to PDP. However, readers who already have some familiarity with PDP models should find that it is possible to use the simulation programs without referring to the PDP volumes. Most important for readers who are new to PDP is the introduction to the PDP framework found in Chapters 1 to 4 of the first PDP volume. Other chapters in the PDP volumes are less essential, since this handbook generally reviews specific material where relevant. However, the PDP volumes generally delve more deeply into the relevant theoretical and empirical background. Rather than repeat this material, we give pointers throughout the handbook to relevant material from the PDP volumes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {A lavishly illustrated book that explores the language of curves that spans the human body, science, engineering, and artCurves are seductive. These smooth, organic lines and surfaces\textemdash like those of the human body\textemdash appeal to us in an instinctive, visceral way that straight lines or the perfect shapes of classical geometry never could. In this large-format book, lavishly illustrated in color throughout, Allan McRobie takes the reader on an alluring exploration of the beautiful curves that shape our world\textemdash from our bodies to Salvador Dal\'i's paintings and the space-time fabric of the universe itself.The book focuses on seven curves\textemdash the fold, cusp, swallowtail, and butterfly, plus the hyperbolic, elliptical, and parabolic ``umbilics''\textemdash and describes the surprising origins of their taxonomy in the catastrophe theory of mathematician Ren\'e Thom. In an accessible discussion illustrated with many photographs of the human nude, McRobie introduces these curves and then describes their role in nature, science, engineering, architecture, art, and other areas. The reader learns how these curves play out in everything from the stability of oil rigs and the study of distant galaxies to rainbows, the patterns of light on pool floors, and even the shape of human genitals. The book also discusses the role of these curves in the work of such artists as David Hockney, Henry Moore, and Anish Kapoor, with particular attention given to the delicate sculptures of Naum Gabo and the final paintings of Dal\'i, who said that Thom's theory ``bewitched all of my atoms.''A unique introduction to the language of beautiful curves, this book may change the way you see the world.},

@book{meadowsThinkingSystemsPrimer2008,
	abstract = {In the years following her role as the lead author of the international bestseller, "Limits to Growth"--The first book to show the consequences of unchecked growth on a finite planet-- Donella Meadows remained a pioneer of environmental and social analysis until her untimely death in 2001. Meadows' newly released manuscript, "Thinking in Systems," is a concise and crucial book offering insight for problem solving on scales ranging from the personal to the global. Edited by the Sustainability Institute's Diana Wright, this essential primer brings systems thinking out of the realm of computers and equations and into the tangible world, showing readers how to develop the systems-thinking skills that thought leaders across the globe consider critical for 21st-century life. Some of the biggest problems facing the world--war, hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation--are essentially system failures. They cannot be solved by fixing one piece in isolation from the others, because even seemingly minor details have enormous power to undermine the best efforts of too-narrow thinking. While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology. Donella Meadows was known as much for nurturing positive outcomes as she was for delving into the science behind global dilemmas. She reminds readers to pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable, to stay humble, and to stay a learner. In a world growing ever more complicated, crowded, and interdependent, "Thinking in Systems" helps readers avoid confusion and helplessness, the first step toward finding proactive and effective solutions.},

	abstract = {The stable functionality of networked systems is a hallmark of their natural ability to coordinate between their multiple interacting components. Yet, real-world networks often appear random and highly irregular, raising the question of what are the naturally emerging organizing principles of complex system stability. The answer is encoded within the system's stability matrix\textemdash the Jacobian\textemdash but is hard to retrieve, due to the scale and diversity of the relevant systems, their broad parameter space and their nonlinear interaction dynamics. Here we introduce the dynamic Jacobian ensemble, which allows us to systematically investigate the fixed-point dynamics of a range of relevant network-based models. Within this ensemble, we find that complex systems exhibit discrete stability classes. These range from asymptotically unstable (where stability is unattainable) to sensitive (where stability abides within a bounded range of system parameters). Alongside these two classes, we uncover a third asymptotically stable class in which a sufficiently large and heterogeneous network acquires a guaranteed stability, independent of its microscopic parameters and robust against external perturbation. Hence, in this ensemble, two of the most ubiquitous characteristics of real-world networks\textemdash scale and heterogeneity\textemdash emerge as natural organizing principles to ensure fixed-point stability in the face of changing environmental conditions.},

It locates philosophical and social influences (such as scientism, practicalism and Pythagoreanism) reshaping the concept and, at the core of this reshaping, identifies a fundamental problem: the issue of whether psychological attributes really are quantitative. It argues that the idea of measurement now endorsed within psychology actually subverts attempts to establish a genuinely quantitative science and it urges a new direction. It relates views on measurement by thinkers such as Holder, Russell, Campbell and Nagel to earlier views, like those of Euclid and Oresme. Within the history of psychology, it considers contributions by Fechner, Cattell, Thorndike, Stevens and Suppes, among others.

It is suggested that certain social interests, identifiable within the history of modern psychology, have produced this situation because of the ideological and economic secondary gains derived from presenting psychology as a quantitative science. The question of whether modern item response models are exempt from this critique is considered, and it is concluded that they have not yet faced up to the challenges of seriously testing the relevant hypothesis or even bothered to recognize its existence.},

In proposing quantitative theories and claiming to measure the attributes involved, psychologists are logically committed to both tasks. However, they have adopted their own, special, definition of measurement, one that deflects attention away from the scientific task. It is argued that this is not accidental. From Fechner onwards, the dominant tradition in quantitative psychology ignored this task. Stevens' definition rationalized this neglect. The widespread acceptance of this definition within psychology made this neglect systemic, with the consequence that the implications of contemporary research in measurement theory for undertaking the scientific task are not appreciated. It is argued further that when the ideological support structures of a science sustain serious blind spots like this, then that science is in the grip of some kind of thought disorder. \ldots unluckily our professors of psychology in general are not up to quantitative logic\ldots{} E.

Such systems--whether political parties, stock markets, or ant colonies--present some of the most intriguing theoretical and practical challenges confronting the social sciences. Engagingly written, and balancing technical detail with intuitive explanations, Complex Adaptive Systems focuses on the key tools and ideas that have emerged in the field since the mid-1990s, as well as the techniques needed to investigate such systems. It provides a detailed introduction to concepts such as emergence, self-organized criticality, automata, networks, diversity, adaptation, and feedback. It also demonstrates how complex adaptive systems can be explored using methods ranging from mathematics to computational models of adaptive agents. John Miller and Scott Page show how to combine ideas from economics, political science, biology, physics, and computer science to illuminate topics in organization, adaptation, decentralization, and robustness. They also demonstrate how the usual extremes used in modeling can be fruitfully transcended, allowing the investigation of systems composed of moderate numbers of interacting and thoughtful, but not perfect, agents across a variety of important domains. Finally, they outline a twenty-first-century research agenda for the social sciences based on these ideas. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The network represents the attitude object and cognitions and beliefs related to the attitude, as well as how to integrate a persuasive message into this network. Short-term effects are modeled by activation patterns due to parallel constraint satisfaction processes, and long-term effects are modeled by weight changes due to the settling patterns of activation. Phenomena modeled include thought-induced attitude polarization, elaboration and attitude strength, motivated reasoning and social influence, an integrated view of heuristic versus systematic persuasion, and implicit versus explicit attitude change. Results of the simulations are consistent with empirical results. The same set of simple mechanisms is used to model all the phenomena, which allows the model to offer a parsimonious theoretical account of how structure can impact attitude change.

	abstract = {We investigate the dynamics of regular fractal-like networks of hierarchically coupled van der Pol oscillators. The hierarchy is imposed in terms of the coupling strengths or link weights. We study the low frequency modes, as well as frequency and phase synchronization, in the network by a process of repeated coarse-graining of oscillator units. At any given stage of this process, we sum over the signals from the oscillator units of a clique to obtain a new oscillating unit. The frequencies and the phases for the coarse-grained oscillators are found to progressively synchronize with the number of coarse-graining steps. Furthermore, the characteristic frequency is found to decrease and finally stabilize to a value that can be tuned via the parameters of the system. We compare our numerical results with those of an approximate analytic solution and find good qualitative agreement. Our study on this idealized model shows how oscillations with a precise frequency can be obtained in systems with heterogeneous couplings. It also demonstrates the effect of imposing a hierarchy in terms of link weights instead of one that is solely topological, where the connectivity between oscillators would be the determining factor, as is usually the case.},

	abstract = {This paper examines how organization theory can benefit from advances made in the interdisciplinary field of complex systems theory (CST). Complex systems theory is not so much a single theory as a perspective for conceptualizing and modeling dynamic systems. The field of complexity is described in terms of the characteristics of systems that are typically the subject of its study, the type of analytical tools used by researchers in this field, and the recurring paradigms that characterize this research perspective. The concepts of self-organized criticality and self-organization and their relevance to organizational studies are examined. The potential usefulness of these concepts is illustrated in the context of organizational evolution and social network analysis. An alternative model of organizational evolution, based on biological evolution, is proposed and propositions are developed. Unlike traditional models for organization, this model does not rely on an algorithm of optimization of a fitness function. The problem of self-organization is approached from the viewpoint of random graph theory and is applied to the analysis of social networks. Finally, important issues in using concepts from the field of CST are discussed. It is suggested that the immediate benefits of CST may be as a framework that facilitates conceptual elaborations and encourages formal modeling; both activities may provide fresh and deep insights into organizational phenomena.},

	abstract = {Object play is essential for infant learning, and infants spend most of their day with objects. Young infants learn about objects and their properties through multimodal exploration facilitated by caregivers. They figure out how to transport their hands to where objects are, and how to grasp objects in increasingly complex ways. Building on earlier experiences, they learn how to use their hands collaboratively to act on objects, and how to use objects to act on other objects in instrumental ways. These changes in how infants use their hands occur during the most rapid period of motor development and may have important downstream implications for other domains. Recent research findings have established the importance of effective fine motor skills for later academic skills, yet our understanding of the factors that influence the early development of hand skills is sparse at best. Latest research on reaching, grasping, object manipulation, hands collaboration, and tool use is reviewed and connections among these developments are explained from the perspective of developmental cascades.

	abstract = {We argue that social networks differ from most other types of networks, including technological and biological networks, in two important ways. First, they have nontrivial clustering or network transitivity and second, they show positive correlations, also called assortative mixing, between the degrees of adjacent vertices. Social networks are often divided into groups or communities, and it has recently been suggested that this division could account for the observed clustering. We demonstrate that group structure in networks can also account for degree correlations. We show using a simple model that we should expect assortative mixing in such networks whenever there is variation in the sizes of the groups and that the predicted level of assortative mixing compares well with that observed in real-world networks.},

Achieving replicability is important for making research progress. If findings are not replicable, then prediction and theory development are stifled. If findings are replicable, then interrogation of their meaning and validity can advance knowledge. Assessing replicability can be productive for generating and testing hypotheses by actively confronting current understandings to identify weaknesses and spur innovation. For psychology, the 2010s might be characterized as a decade of active confrontation. Systematic and multi-site replication projects assessed current understandings and observed surprising failures to replicate many published findings. Replication efforts highlighted sociocultural challenges such as disincentives to conduct replications and a tendency to frame replication as a personal attack rather than a healthy scientific practice, and they raised awareness that replication contributes to self-correction. Nevertheless, innovation in doing and understanding replication and its cousins, reproducibility and robustness, has positioned psychology to improve research practices and accelerate progress.},

As such, the paper is appropriate for those interested in modeling virtually all levels of living systems and subsystems which can be described by catastrophe theory models, as well as those interested in testing cross-level hypotheses about such systems and subsystems. The lack of such flexible estimation procedures has limited the potential application of catastrophe modeling in the social and behavioral sciences. More specifically, a methodology called GEMCAT is presented, using the cusp model for expositional convenience, which allows the traditional canonical catastrophe model variables to be described as latent constructs of univariate or multivariate observable variable sets. A Monte Carlo analysis is presented demonstrating the performance of the methodology under various conditions. Furthermore, it is shown how this method is superior to the common practice of generating univariate composites (e.g., by summing, averaging, etc.) which has been traditionally used because of either computational convenience or the lack of such a methodology.},

Yet a theory of psychopathology grounded in the principles of complex adaptive systems is lacking. Here, we present such a theory based on the notion of dynamic patterns: patterns that are formed over time. We propose that psychopathology can be understood as a dynamic pattern that emerges from self-organized interactions between interdependent biopsychosocial processes in a complex adaptive system comprising a person in their environment. Psychopathology is emergent in the sense that it refers to the person-environment system as a whole and cannot be reduced to specific system parts. Psychopathology as a dynamic pattern is also self-organized, meaning that it arises solely from the interdependencies in the system: the interactions between countless biopsychosocial variables. All possible manifestations of psychopathology will correspond to a wide variety of dynamic patterns. Yet we propose that the development of these patterns over time can be described by general principles of pattern formation in complex adaptive systems.

Data were collected from 328 patients receiving psychotherapy for mood disorders who completed daily self-ratings about their therapeutic process using the Therapy Process Questionnaire (TPQ).

@book{ooyenRewiringBrainComputational2017,
	abstract = {The adult brain is not as hard-wired as traditionally thought. By modifying their small- or large-scale morphology, neurons can make new synaptic connections or break existing ones (structural plasticity). Structural changes accompany memory formation and learning, and are induced by neurogenesis, neurodegeneration and brain injury such as stroke.  Exploring the role of structural plasticity in the brain can be greatly assisted by mathematical and computational models, as they enable us to bridge the gap between system-level dynamics and lower level cellular and molecular processes. However, most traditional neural network models have fixed neuronal morphologies and a static connectivity pattern, with plasticity merely arising from changes in the strength of existing synapses (synaptic plasticity). In The Rewiring Brain, the editors bring together for the first time contemporary modeling studies that investigate the implications of structural plasticity for brain function and pathology. Starting with an experimental background on structural plasticity in the adult brain, the book covers computational studies on homeostatic structural plasticity, the impact of structural plasticity on cognition and cortical connectivity, the interaction between synaptic and structural plasticity, neurogenesis-related structural plasticity, and structural plasticity in neurological disorders. Structural plasticity adds a whole new dimension to brain plasticity, and The Rewiring Brain shows how computational approaches may help to gain a better understanding of the full adaptive potential of the adult brain. The book is written for both computational and experimental neuroscientists.  Reviews the current state of knowledge of structural plasticity in the adult brain Gives a comprehensive overview of computational studies on structural plasticity Provides insights into the potential driving forces of structural plasticity and the functional implications of structural plasticity for learning and memory Serves as inspiration for developing novel treatment strategies for stimulating functional repair after brain damage},

	abstract = {Genetic influences on personality differences are ubiquitous, but their nature is not well understood. A theoretical framework might help, and can be provided by evolutionary genetics. We assess three evolutionary genetic mechanisms that could explain genetic variance in personality differences: selective neutrality, mutation-selection balance, and balancing selection. Based on evolutionary genetic theory and empirical results from behaviour genetics and personality psychology, we conclude that selective neutrality is largely irrelevant, that mutation-selection balance seems best at explaining genetic variance in intelligence, and that balancing selection by environmental heterogeneity seems best at explaining genetic variance in personality traits. We propose a general model of heritable personality differences that conceptualises intelligence as fitness components and personality traits as individual reaction norms of genotypes across environments, with different fitness consequences in different environmental niches. We also discuss the place of mental health in the model. This evolutionary genetic framework highlights the role of gene-environment interactions in the study of personality, yields new insight into the person-situation-debate and the structure of personality, and has practical implications for both quantitative and molecular genetic studies of personality.

	abstract = {Extensive cooperation among unrelated individuals is unique to humans, who often sacrifice personal benefits for the common good and work together to achieve what they are unable to execute alone. The evolutionary success of our species is indeed due, to a large degree, to our unparalleled other-regarding abilities. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of human cooperation remains a formidable challenge. Recent research in the social sciences indicates that it is important to focus on the collective behavior that emerges as the result of the interactions among individuals, groups, and even societies. Non-equilibrium statistical physics, in particular Monte Carlo methods and the theory of collective behavior of interacting particles near phase transition points, has proven to be very valuable for understanding counterintuitive evolutionary outcomes. By treating models of human cooperation as classical spin models, a physicist can draw on familiar settings from statistical physics. However, unlike pairwise interactions among particles that typically govern solid-state physics systems, interactions among humans often involve group interactions, and they also involve a larger number of possible states even for the most simplified description of reality. The complexity of solutions therefore often surpasses that observed in physical systems. Here we review experimental and theoretical research that advances our understanding of human cooperation, focusing on spatial pattern formation, on the spatiotemporal dynamics of observed solutions, and on self-organization that may either promote or hinder socially favorable states.},

@article{plenzSelfOrganizedCriticalityBrain2021,
	abstract = {Self-organized criticality (SOC) refers to the ability of complex systems to evolve toward a second-order phase transition at which interactions between system components lead to scale-invariant events that are beneficial for system performance. For the last two decades, considerable experimental evidence has accumulated that the mammalian cortex with its diversity in cell types, interconnectivity, and plasticity might exhibit SOC. Here, we review the experimental findings of isolated, layered cortex preparations to self-organize toward four dynamical motifs presently identified in the intact cortex in vivo: up-states, oscillations, neuronal avalanches, and coherence potentials. During up-states, the synchronization observed for nested theta/gamma oscillations embeds scale-invariant neuronal avalanches, which can be identified by robust power law scaling in avalanche sizes with a slope of -3/2 and a critical branching parameter of 1. This precise dynamical coordination, tracked in the negative transients of the local field potential (nLFP) and spiking activity of pyramidal neurons using two-photon imaging, emerges autonomously in superficial layers of organotypic cortex cultures and acute cortex slices, is homeostatically regulated, exhibits separation of time scales, and reveals unique size vs. quiet time dependencies. A subclass of avalanches, the coherence potentials, exhibits precise maintenance of the time course in propagated local synchrony. Avalanches emerge in superficial layers of the cortex under conditions of strong external drive. The balance of excitation and inhibition (E/I), as well as neuromodulators such as dopamine, establishes powerful control parameters for avalanche dynamics. This rich dynamical repertoire is not observed in dissociated cortex cultures, which lack the differentiation into cortical layers and exhibit a dynamical phenotype expected for a first-order phase transition. The precise interactions between up-states, nested oscillations, and avalanches in superficial layers of the cortex provide compelling evidence for SOC in the brain.},

Knowledge of the course of untreated depression can serve as a benchmark for assessing the true benefits of active treatment. Method: A meta-analysis was performed analyzing the outcomes of all psychotherapy studies that randomized adult outpatients with major depressive disorder to a wait-list control group. Results: Nineteen studies involving 221 subjects were reviewed. The mean decrease in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores over 2\textendash 20 weeks was 11.9\%, while the mean decrease in Beck Depression Inventory scores was 15.7\%. Using a subsample of studies that reported individual outcomes, we estimated that 15 of 76 subjects (19.7\%) improved to a degree comparable to what would be considered a positive response in antidepressant trials. Conclusions: In the short-term, depressive symptomatology can be expected to decrease by about 10\textendash 15\% on average without treatment. As many as 20\% of subjects who participate in a short-term antidepressant trial may experience a spontaneous remission.},

One variety of self-organization that can be produced by such systems is deterministic chaos (popularly, ``chaos''). Although chaos was first described by Poincar6 in the 1800s, recent years have witnessed major developments in the physics of chaotic systems (Crutchfield, Farmer, Packard, \& Shaw, 1986; Eubank \& Farmer, 1990; Glass \& Mackey, 1988; Gleick, 1987; Guevara, Glass, Mackey, \& Shrier, 1983; Middleton, 1990; Schuster, 1988; Stewart, 1989; Tsonis \& Tsonis, 1989; van Rossum \& de Bie, 1991). Beginning in the mid 1980s, scientists began to apply chaos theory to the human electroencephalogram, or EEG (Albano et al., 1986; Babloyantz \& Destexhe, 1986; Bab-loyantz, Salazar, \& Nicolis, 1985; Dvo\v{r}\'ak \& \v{S}I\v{s}ka, 1986; Dvo\v{r}\'ak, \v{S}I\v{s}ka, Wackermann, Hrudov\'a, \& Dost\'alek, 1986; Holzfuss \& Mayer-Kress, 1986; Layne, Mayer-Kress, \& Holzfuss, 1986; Rapp et al., 1985; for pioneering thoughts, see Basar, 1983a, 1983b; this literature will be reviewed in greater detail below).},

This process can be linked to the behaviors of populations of neurons and to theories of optimality.

This article critically appraises evidence for the effectiveness and value of antidepressant drugs and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), the two principle physical treatments recommended for depression. It also describes the negative effects of these interventions and raises concerns about how they impact the brain. We propose an alternative understanding that recognises depression as an emotional and meaningful response to unwanted life events and circumstances. This perspective demands that we address the social conditions that make depression likely and suggests that a combination of politics and common sense needs to guide us in providing help for one another when we are suffering in this way. This alternative view is increasingly endorsed around the world, including by the United Nations, the World Health Organization and service users who have suffered negative consequences of physical treatments that modify brain functions in ways that are not well-understood.},

This is due to continued progress in three key areas: a mathematical understanding of locomotion, the computational ability to encode this mathematics through optimization, and the hardware capable of realizing this understanding in practice. In this context, this review outlines the end-to-end process of methods that have proven effective in the literature for achieving dynamic walking on bipedal robots. We begin by introducing mathematical models of locomotion, from reduced-order models that capture essential walking behaviors to hybrid dynamical systems that encode the full-order continuous dynamics along with discrete foot-strike dynamics. These models form the basis for gait generation via (nonlinear) optimization problems. Finally, models and their generated gaits merge in the context of real-time control, wherein walking behaviors are translated to hardware. The concepts presented are illustrated throughout in simulation, and experimental instantiations on multiple walking platforms are highlighted to demonstrate the ability to realize dynamic walking on bipedal robots that is both agile and efficient.},

	abstract = {Background While both theory and empirical findings have supported impaired self-control as a crucial factor in understanding problem drinking, little is known about the relationship of self-control and drinking in naturalistic settings. The present study uses Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) to examine the predictive relationships between impaired subjective self-control, craving and alcohol use in everyday life. Methods A sample of 172 regular drinkers responded on their smartphone to three random prompts each day for seven days in which amount of perceived self-control and craving were measured with self-report. In the meantime, participants were instructed to initiate an EMA report when they started drinking alcohol. Results Findings supported the hypotheses that impaired self-control and higher craving levels were prospectively related to the likelihood that people will drink. That is, on random assessments that preceded drinking (i.e., were within two hours of drinking), perceived self-control was lower and craving was higher compared to random assessments that were not followed by drinking. Additionally, during drink consumption, impaired self-control and craving were associated with a higher amount of expected alcohol consumption. Findings further indicated that subjective self-control acted as a moderator of the relationship between craving and alcohol consumption during drinking occasions. Conclusions By using a smartphone mobile application, this study showed that impaired subjective self-control and craving are prospectively related to alcohol use in the real-world. Furthermore, findings are consistent with theories of addiction that substance use might be associated with the interplay of control processes and increased motivation.},

The equations take into account three mechanisms of love growth and decay: the pleasure of being loved (return), the reaction to the partner's appeal (instinct), and the forgetting processes (oblivion). Under suitable assumptions on the behavior of the individuals, the model turns out to be a positive linear system enjoying, as such, a number of remarkable properties, which are in agreement with common wisdom on the argument. These properties are used to explore the consequences that individual behavior can have on the community structure. The main result along this line is that individual appeal is the driving force that creates order in the community. Possible extensions of this theory of linear love dynamics are briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {Traveling patterns of neuronal activity\textemdash brain waves\textemdash have been observed across a breadth of neuronal recordings, states of awareness, and species, but their emergence in the human brain lacks a firm understanding. Here we analyze the complex nonlinear dynamics that emerge from modeling large-scale spontaneous neural activity on a whole-brain network derived from human tractography. We find a rich array of three-dimensional wave patterns, including traveling waves, spiral waves, sources, and sinks. These patterns are metastable, such that multiple spatiotemporal wave patterns are visited in sequence. Transitions between states correspond to reconfigurations of underlying phase flows, characterized by nonlinear instabilities. These metastable dynamics accord with empirical data from multiple imaging modalities, including electrical waves in cortical tissue, sequential spatiotemporal patterns in resting-state MEG data, and large-scale waves in human electrocorticography. By moving the study of functional networks from a spatially static to an inherently dynamic (wave-like) frame, our work unifies apparently diverse phenomena across functional neuroimaging modalities and makes specific predictions for further experimentation.},

	abstract = {This book represents the best of the first three years of the Society for Chaos Theory in Psychology conferences. While chaos theory has been a topic of considerable interest in the physical and biological sciences, its applications in psychology and related fields have been obscured until recently by its complexity. Nevertheless, a small but rapidly growing community of psychologists, neurobiologists, sociologists, mathematicians, and philosophers have been coming together to discuss its implications and explore its research possibilities.   Chaos theory has been termed the first authentic paradigm shift since the advent of quantum physics. Whether this is true or not, it unquestionably bears profound implications for many fields of thought. These include the cognitive analysis of the mind, the nature of personality, the dynamics of psychotherapy and counseling, understanding brain events and behavioral records, the dynamics of social organization, and the psychology of prediction. To each of these topics, chaos theory brings the perspective of dynamic self-organizing processes of exquisite complexity. Behavior, the nervous system, and social processes exhibit many of the classical characteristics of chaotic systems -- they are deterministic and globally predictable and yet do not submit to precise predictability.   This volume is the first to explore ideas from chaos theory in a broad, psychological perspective. Its introduction, by the prominent neuroscientist Walter Freeman, sets the tone for diverse discussions of the role of chaos theory in behavioral research, the study of personality, psychotherapy and counseling, mathematical cognitive psychology, social organization, systems philosophy, and the understanding of the brain.},

This overarching framework has proven highly generative but does not specify precisely how any specific mental disorder operates as such a system. We address this gap in the literature by developing a network theory of Panic Disorder and formalizing that theory as a computational model. We first review prior psychological theory and research on Panic Disorder in order to identify its core components as well as the plausible causal relations among those components. We then construct and evaluate a computational model of Panic Disorder as a non-linear dynamical system. We show that this model can explain a great deal, including individual differences in the propensity to experience panic attacks, key phenomenological characteristics of those attacks, the onset of Panic Disorder, and the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy. We also show that the model identifies significant gaps in our understanding of Panic Disorder and propose a theory-driven research agenda for Panic Disorder that follows from our evaluation of the model. We conclude by discussing the implications of the model for how we understand and investigate mental disorders as complex systems.},

In addition, we turn our attention to the next decade of the network approach and propose critical avenues for future research in each of these domains.

	abstract = {Although multiple differences between typically and atypically developing children have been robustly observed in empirical studies, we lack a unified theoretical framework on how these observed differences in cognitive phenotypes might arise. Here, we introduce a first step to- wards such a framework based on an extension of the mutualistic network model, which conceptualizes cognitive development in terms of reciprocal interactions between cognitive processes that promote each other's growth. We extend the mutualistic network model with dy- namic mechanisms of competition for limited resources, such as time and environmental factors. By doing so, the modelling framework defines both an empirical and theoretical research agenda. We show that this relatively simple model generates patterns of development that potentially explain five established phenomena in cognitive development: (1) developmental phases, (2) slower cognitive development in atypical cohorts, (3) lack of early indicators for atypical development, (4) developmental regression in the autistic profile, and (5) "quasi-autism" caused by extreme environmental deprivation. Theoretically, the presented framework fits a generic movement towards formal theory con- struction. The model can easily be reproduced and developed further through our openly available code, and we offer several paths forward in doing so.},

@article{rosencransNetworkApproachPosttraumatic2021,
	abstract = {Objective: Trauma-related fear (e.g., reexperiencing), impaired reward (e.g., anhedonia), and interpersonal (e.g., detachment) processes may be functionally intertwined, giving rise to chronic psychopathology after a trauma. Network analyses can help pinpoint symptom drivers and treatment targets, but studies examining posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment-seeking individuals are lacking. Method: Treatment-seeking adults with primary PTSD (N = 350) completed interview and self-report measures of PTSD severity (PSS-I; PSS-SR). Self-report and interview-based networks were estimated and compared. Results: Both networks suggested distinct but interconnected communities of reexperiencing and dysphoric symptoms (e.g., interpersonal detachment, numbing). Centrality profiles were strongly associated across networks (rs = .71), with cued reexperiencing and interpersonal detachment showing strong centrality. Self-reported symptoms were more interconnected, suggesting lower specificity. Conclusions: For those seeking treatment, interrelated fear and interpersonal processes may drive functional impairment in PTSD, and interview-based networks may help better delineate influential symptoms. Therapeutically, targeting cued reexperiencing and interpersonal detachment may facilitate broader symptom decreases. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

@article{roxinNeurobiologicalModelsTwoChoice2008,
	abstract = {The response behaviors in many two-alternative choice tasks are well described by so-called sequential sampling models. In these models, the evidence for each one of the two alternatives accumulates over time until it reaches a threshold, at which point a response is made. At the neurophysiological level, single neuron data recorded while monkeys are engaged in two-alternative choice tasks are well described by winner-take-all network models in which the two choices are represented in the firing rates of separate populations of neurons. Here, we show that such nonlinear network models can generally be reduced to a one-dimensional nonlinear diffusion equation, which bears functional resemblance to standard sequential sampling models of behavior. This reduction gives the functional dependence of performance and reaction-times on external inputs in the original system, irrespective of the system details. What is more, the nonlinear diffusion equation can provide excellent fits to behavioral data from two-choice decision making tasks by varying these external inputs. This suggests that changes in behavior under various experimental conditions, e.g. changes in stimulus coherence or response deadline, are driven by internal modulation of afferent inputs to putative decision making circuits in the brain. For certain model systems one can analytically derive the nonlinear diffusion equation, thereby mapping the original system parameters onto the diffusion equation coefficients. Here, we illustrate this with three model systems including coupled rate equations and a network of spiking neurons.},

However, since network models are not presented as causal discovery tools, the role they play in generating causal insights is poorly understood among empirical researchers. In this paper, we provide a treatment of how PMRFs such as the Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) work as causal discovery tools, using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and Structural Equation Models (SEMs) as causal models. We describe the key assumptions needed for causal discovery and show the equivalence class of causal models that networks identify from data.

@article{sachisthalIntroducingScienceInterest2019,
	abstract = {In this article, a science interest network model (SINM) is introduced and a first empirical test of the model is presented. The SINM models interest as a dynamic relational construct, in which different interest components, that is, affective, behavioral, and cognitive components and related motivational components mutually reinforce one another within the development of interest. The dynamical relational perspective hypothesizes that the mutual interactions between interest components underlie the development of interest. Applying the SINM to the PISA 2015 data of 2 countries, that is, the Netherlands and Colombia, we were able to not only illuminate the structure of interactions between the different variables (i.e., indicators) in the networks of different groups of adolescents but we could also make predictions about which variables are of structural importance within the interest construct and as such worthwhile to test as potential candidates for intervention. Additionally, we were able to replicate earlier findings of the literature, namely that (a) enjoyment is central within the interest network and that (b) important structural differences exist in the interest network across countries, which, for instance, point to differences in domain specificity of interest between countries. While the network approach is sensitive to structural differences in science interest across countries, the network structure is stable across subgroups within countries. Future studies are proposed to test theoretically important assumptions of a dynamical perspective on interest, such as the causal role of different interest components in the development of interest.

@article{salaFarTransferCognitive2019,
	abstract = {Theory building in science requires replication and integration of findings regarding a particular research question. Second-order meta-analysis (i.e., a meta-analysis of meta-analyses) offers a powerful tool for achieving this aim, and we use this technique to illuminate the controversial field of cognitive training. Recent replication attempts and large meta-analytic investigations have shown that the benefits of cognitive-training programs hardly go beyond the trained task and similar tasks. However, it is yet to be established whether the effects differ across cognitive-training programs and populations (children, adults, and older adults). We addressed this issue by using second-order meta-analysis. In Models 1 (k = 99) and 2 (k = 119), we investigated the impact of working-memory training on near-transfer (i.e., memory) and far-transfer (e.g., reasoning, speed, and language) measures, respectively, and whether it is mediated by the type of population. Model 3 (k = 233) extended Model 2 by adding six meta-analyses assessing the far-transfer effects of other cognitive-training programs (video-games, music, chess, and exergames). Model 1 showed that working-memory training does induce near transfer, and that the size of this effect is moderated by the type of population. By contrast, Models 2 and 3 highlighted that far-transfer effects are small or null. Crucially, when placebo effects and publication bias were controlled for, the overall effect size and true variance equaled zero. That is, no impact on far-transfer measures was observed regardless of the type of population and cognitive-training program. The lack of generalization of skills acquired by training is thus an invariant of human cognition.},

Chaotic systems are non-linear deterministic dynamic systems which can behave like an erratic and apparently random motion. A relevant field inside chaos theory is the detection of chaotic behavior from empirical time-series data. One of the main features of chaos is the well-known initial-value sensitivity property. Methods and techniques related to testing the hypothesis of chaos try to quantify the initial-value sensitive property estimating the so-called Lyapunov exponents. This paper describes the main estimation methods of the Lyapunov exponent from time series data. At the same time, we present the DChaos library. R users may compute the delayed-coordinate embedding vector from time series data, estimates the best-fitted neural net model from the delayed-coordinate embedding vectors, calculates analytically the partial derivatives from the chosen neural nets model. They can also obtain the neural net estimator of the Lyapunov exponent from the partial derivatives computed previously by two different procedures and four ways of subsampling by blocks. To sum up, the DChaos package allows the R users to test robustly the hypothesis of chaos in order to know if the data-generating process behind time series behaves chaotically or not. The package's functionality is illustrated by examples.},

  abstract = {Dynamical systems theory is widely used to explain tipping points, cycles, and chaos in complex systems ranging from the climate to ecosystems. It has been suggested that the same theory may be used to explain the nature and dynamics of psychiatric disorders, which may come and go with symptoms changing over a lifetime. Here we review evidence for the practical applicability of this theory and its quantitative tools in psychiatry.Emerging results suggest that time series of mood and behavior may be used to monitor the resilience of patients using the same generic dynamical indicators that are now employed globally to monitor the risks of collapse of complex systems, such as tropical rainforest and tipping elements of the climate system. Other dynamical systems tools used in ecology and climate science open ways to infer personalized webs of causality for patients that may be used to identify targets for intervention. Meanwhile, experiences in ecological restoration help make sense of the occasional long-term success of short interventions.Those observations, while promising, evoke follow-up questions on how best to collect dynamic data, infer informative timescales, construct mechanistic models, and measure the effect of interventions on resilience. Done well, monitoring resilience to inform well-timed interventions may be integrated into approaches that give patients an active role in the lifelong challenge of managing their resilience and knowing when to seek professional help.}

This is an abstract study of the interactive dynamics of discriminatory individual choices. One model is a simulation in which individual members of two recognizable groups distribute themselves in neighborhoods defined by reference to their own locations. A second model is analytic and deals with compartmented space. A final section applies the analytics to `neighborhood tipping.' The systemic effects are found to be overwhelming: there is no simple correspondence of individual incentive to collective results. Exaggerated separation and patterning result from the dynamics of movement. Inferences about individual motives can usually not be drawn from aggregate patterns. Some unexpected phenomena, like density and vacancy, are generated. A general theory of `tipping' begins to emerge.},

This study investigated the differential stability of the 2 phase modes. In Experiment 1, in which Ss were instructed to remain in the initial phase mode, the alternate phase mode was found to be less stable as the frequency of oscillation increased. In addition, analysis of the nonsteady state cycles revealed evidence of a switching to the symmetric phase mode for the initial alternate phase mode trials. In Experiments 2 and 3, Ss were instructed to remain at a noninitial phase angle if it was found to be more comfortable. The transition observed between the 2 phase modes satisfies the criteria of a physical bifurcation--hysteresis, critical fluctuations, and divergence--and is consonant with previous findings on transitions in limb coordination within a person.},

@article{schonerDynamicsNeuralPopulations2020,
	abstract = {What would it mean to explain the mind in neural terms? Neural accounts of the mind are often sought in a reductionistic spirit in which neural mechanisms explain cognition. Because an individual's thoughts and behaviors are not reproducible without careful control of task, stimulus, and behavioral history, laws of the mind are the currency of psychology. Reduction may thus have to take the form familiar from physics: deriving macroscopic laws from microscopic laws. I argue that the metaphor of reduction from non-equilibrium physics may be the most appropriate. Macroscopic patterns of neural activity, which cause behavior and thought, are slow dynamical variables that dominate the fast microscopic dynamics of individual neurons and synapses. I outline a theoretical framework in which strongly recurrent neural networks, described by neural dynamics, generate neural representations as attractor states that are embedded in low-dimensional feature spaces. Instabilities of these states are instrumental in decision-making and the generation of sequences of mental states that are the basis for higher cognition. Networks of such neural population dynamics form neural cognitive architectures that capture the laws of the mind.},

Unlike the traditional analysis of the physics of macroscopic many-body or condensed matter systems, which is now an established and mature subject, the upsurge in the physical analysis and modelling of social systems, which are clearly many-body dynamical systems, is a recent phenomenon. Though the major developments in sociophysics have taken place only recently, the earliest attempts of proposing "Social Physics" as a discipline are more than one and a half centuries old. Various developments in the mainstream physics of condensed matter systems have inspired and induced the recent growth of sociophysical analysis and models. In spite of the tremendous efforts of many scientists in recent years, the subject is still in its infancy and major challenges are yet to be taken up.

Evidence from our EEG research on the olfactory bulb suggests that the brain may indeed use computational mechanisms like those found in connectionist models. In the present paper we discuss our data and develop a model to describe the neural dynamics responsible for odor recognition and discrimination. The results indicate the existence of sensory- and motor-specific information in the spatial dimension of EEG activity and call for new physiological metaphors and techniques of analysis. Special emphasis is placed in our model on chaotic neural activity. We hypothesize that chaotic behavior serves as the essential ground state for the neural perceptual apparatus, and we propose a mechanism for acquiring new forms of patterned activity corresponding to new learned odors. Finally, some of the implications of our neural model for behavioral theories are briefly discussed. Our research, in concert with the connectionist work, encourages a reevaluation of explanatory models that are based only on the digital computer metaphor.},

There may have been times when developments in neuroscience, artificial intelligence, or cognitive psychology seduced researchers into believing that their discipline was on the verge of discovering the secret of intelligence. But a humbling history of hopes disappointed has produced the realization that understanding the mind will challenge the power of all these methodologies combined. The work reported in this chapter rests on the conviction that a methodology that has a crucial role to play in the development of cognitive science is mathematical analysis. The success of cognitive science, like that of many other sciences, will, I believe, depend upon the construction of a solid body of theoretical results results that express in a mathematical language the conceptual insights of the field results that squeeze all possible implications out of those insights by exploiting powerful mathematical techniques. This body of results, which I will call the theory of information processing, exists because information is a concept that lends itself to mathematical formalization. One part of the theory of information processing is already well-developed. The classical theory of computation provides powerful and elegant results about the notion of effective procedure, including languages for precisely expressing them and theoretical machines for realizing them.},

The dependent variable is the changing (or evolving) relation network, represented by two or more observations of a directed graph with a fixed set of actors. The network evolution is modeled as the consequence of the actors making new choices, or withdrawing existing choices, on the basis of functions, with fixed and random components, that the actors try to maximize. Individual and dyadic exogenous variables can be used as covariates. The change in the network is modeled as the stochastic result of network effects (reciprocity, transitivity, etc.) and these covariates. The existing network structure is a dynamic constraint for the evolution of the structure itself. The models are continuous-time Markov chain models that can be implemented as simulation models. The model parameters are estimated from observed data. For estimating and testing these models, statistical procedures are proposed that are based on the method of moments. The statistical procedures are implemented using a stochastic approximation algorithm based on computer simulations of the network evolution process.},

The agents communicate via messages, which allows direct application of the model to ICT based communities. We study the dependence of the composition of an agent society on the range of interactions and the rate of emotional arousal.

Moreover, to meet the challenge of understanding the globally growing political polarization and changes brought by increasing reliance on electronic communication, the models should adapt to the post-truth era. It is necessary to include in the models phenomena such as fake news, omnipresent exaggerations and stereotypes, trolling, and algorithmic biases funneling personal information universe.

Experiments were confined to testing the sensory discrimination of hearing, sight and touch, using the monochord, a graduated series of colored cards, and a graduated series of weights constructed on Galton's cartridge pattern, respectively, for the three conditioned. Five series of experiments were conducted involving varying number of Ss. The results indicated that all branches of intellectual activity possess in common one fundamental function, whereas the remaining or specific elements of the activity seem to be wholly different from that in all the others. In adult life no difference between the two sexes was observed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

To this end, we develop a data analysis method for estimating parameters associated with these deterministic and stochastic components.

@article{steyversLargeScaleStructureSemantic2005,

We show that they have a small-world structure, characterized by sparse connectivity, short average path lengths between words, and strong local clustering. In addition, the distributions of the number of connections follow power laws that indicate a scale-free pattern of connectivity, with most nodes having relatively few connections joined together through a small number of hubs with many connections. These regularities have also been found in certain other complex natural networks, such as the World Wide Web, but they are not consistent with many conventional models of semantic organization, based on inheritance hierarchies, arbitrarily structured networks, or high-dimensional vector spaces. We propose that these structures reflect the mechanisms by which semantic networks grow. We describe a simple model for semantic growth, in which each new word or concept is connected to an existing network by differentiating the connectivity pattern of an existing node. This model generates appropriate small-world statistics and power-law connectivity distributions, and it also suggests one possible mechanistic basis for the effects of learning history variables (age of acquisition, usage frequency) on behavioral performance in semantic processing tasks.},

@incollection{tesserSelfGeneratedAttitude1978,
	abstract = {This chapter discusses self-generated attitude change. The thought about some nonneutral attitude object in the absence of any new external information or change in overt behavior often results in attitude polarization. Attitude polarization seems to be predicated on cognitive changes such as the addition of consistent cognitions and the reinterpretation of existing inconsistent cognitions. Such changes in cognitions and affect are expected to occur only to the extent that persons have a developed cognitive schema for thinking about the object. One's attitude is a function of those salient cognitions and inferences. The data suggest that persons can tune in more than one schema for thinking about a particular object. Thus, persons have the potential for more than one attitude toward the same object. Some implications for the relationship between attitudes and behavior and for psychotherapy were touched upon. The relationship between this research and group polarization research and mere exposure research are briefly explored.

Beginning with their own research in motor, perceptual, and cognitive development, Thelen and Smith raise fundamental questions about prevailing assumptions in the field. They propose a new theory of the development of cognition and action, unifying recent advances in dynamic systems theory with current research in neuroscience and neural development. In particular, they show how by processes of exploration and selection, multimodal experiences form the bases for self-organizing perception-action categories. Thelen and Smith offer a radical alternative to current cognitive theory, both in their emphasis on dynamic representation and in their focus on processes of change. Among the first attempt to apply complexity theory to psychology, they suggest reinterpretations of several classic issues in early cognitive development. The book is divided into three sections. The first discusses the nature of developmental processes in general terms, the second covers dynamic principles in process and mechanism, and the third looks at how a dynamic theory can be applied to enduring puzzles of development.

@article{tokerSimpleMethodDetecting2020,
	abstract = {Chaos, or exponential sensitivity to small perturbations, appears everywhere in nature. Moreover, chaos is predicted to play diverse functional roles in living systems. A method for detecting chaos from empirical measurements should therefore be a key component of the biologist's toolkit. But, classic chaos-detection tools are highly sensitive to measurement noise and break down for common edge cases, making it difficult to detect chaos in domains, like biology, where measurements are noisy. However, newer tools promise to overcome these limitations. Here, we combine several such tools into an automated processing pipeline, and show that our pipeline can detect the presence (or absence) of chaos in noisy recordings, even for difficult edge cases. As a first-pass application of our pipeline, we show that heart rate variability is not chaotic as some have proposed, and instead reflects a stochastic process in both health and disease. Our tool is easy-to-use and freely available.},

@article{tononiMeasureBrainComplexity1994,
	abstract = {In brains of higher vertebrates, the functional segregation of local areas that differ in their anatomy and physiology contrasts sharply with their global integration during perception and behavior. In this paper, we introduce a measure, called neural complexity (CN), that captures the interplay between these two fundamental aspects of brain organization. We express functional segregation within a neural system in terms of the relative statistical independence of small subsets of the system and functional integration in terms of significant deviations from independence of large subsets. CN is then obtained from estimates of the average deviation from statistical independence for subsets of increasing size. CN is shown to be high when functional segregation coexists with integration and to be low when the components of a system are either completely independent (segregated) or completely dependent (integrated). We apply this complexity measure in computer simulations of cortical areas to examine how some basic principles of neuroanatomical organization constrain brain dynamics. We show that the connectivity patterns of the cerebral cortex, such as a high density of connections, strong local connectivity organizing cells into neuronal groups, patchiness in the connectivity among neuronal groups, and prevalent reciprocal connections, are associated with high values of CN. The approach outlined here may prove useful in analyzing complexity in other biological domains such as gene regulation and embryogenesis.},

	abstract = {We present data from several German freeways showing different kinds of congested traffic forming near road inhomogeneities, specifically lane closings, intersections, or uphill gradients. The states are localized or extended, homogeneous or oscillating. Combined states are observed as well, like the coexistence of moving localized clusters and clusters pinned at road inhomogeneities, or regions of oscillating congested traffic upstream of nearly homogeneous congested traffic. The experimental findings are consistent with a recently proposed theoretical phase diagram for traffic near on-ramps [D. Helbing, A. Hennecke, and M. Treiber, Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 4360 (1999)]. We simulate these situations with a continuous microscopic single-lane model, the ``intelligent driver model,'' using empirical boundary conditions. All observations, including the coexistence of states, are qualitatively reproduced by describing inhomogeneities with local variations of one model parameter. We show that the results of the microscopic model can be understood by formulating the theoretical phase diagram for bottlenecks in a more general way. In particular, a local drop of the road capacity induced by parameter variations has essentially the same effect as an on-ramp.},

	abstract = {We test if a change in an attitude affects other related attitudes (i.e., dynamic constraint), a core prediction of belief systems theory. We use psychological network methods to represent the belief system and make preregistered predictions about which attitudes should change and to what extent. We collected data in two longitudinal experiments (N~=~3004; N~=~2999) and three pilot studies (combined N~=~2788) from community samples of US Americans. We use data from T1 as pretest measures of attitudes and to estimate the structure of the sample's belief system from which to generate and preregister predictions. At T2 participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a control condition (no manipulation), a terrorism attitude manipulation (Study 1), a crime attitude manipulation (Study 2) attitude manipulation, or a banking attitude manipulation (Studies 1 \& 2). We successfully manipulated the targeted attitude and also observed changes in non-targeted attitudes in the belief system. Multilevel models provided evidence that changes in non-targeted attitudes were moderated by their distance from the targeted attitude within the belief system: Non-targeted attitudes closer to the experimentally targeted attitude typically changed more. Changes in non-targeted attitudes were generally related to (and mediated by) changes in the targeted attitude. We discuss the implications of our findings for belief systems theory and the value of network methods in studying attitude change.},

Using data from the minicomputer, cement, and airline industries from their births through 1980, we demonstrate that technology evolves through periods of incremental change punctuated by technological break-throughs that either enhance or destroy the competence of firms in an industry. These breakthroughs, or technological discontinuities, significantly increase both environmental uncertainty and munificence. The study shows that while competence-destroying discontinuities are initiated by new firms and are associated with increased environmental turbulence, competence-enhancing discontinuities are initiated by existing firms and are associated with decreased environmental turbulence. These effects decrease over successive discontinuities. Those firms that initiate major technological changes grow more rapidly than other firms.},

@article{uherPsychometricsNotMeasurement2021,
	abstract = {Psychometrics has always been confronted with fundamental criticism, highlighting serious insufficiencies and fallacies. Many fallacies persist, however, because each critic explores only some fallacies while still building on others. This article scrutinizes the epistemological, metatheoretical, and methodological foundations of psychometrics, revealing a complex network of numerous conceptual fallacies underlying its framework of theory and practice. At its core lies a key challenge for psychology: the necessity to distinguish the phenomena under study from the means used to explore them (e.g., concepts, methods, data). This distinction is intricate because concepts constitute psychical phenomena in themselves and many psychical phenomena are accessible only through language-based methods. The analyses show how insufficient consideration of this important distinction and common misconceptions about concepts and language (e.g., signifier\textendash referent conflation, reification of constructs) led to conflations of disparate notions of key terms in psychological measurement (e.g., ``variables'', ``attributes'', ``causality'') and numerous interrelated fallacies (e.g., construct\textendash referent conflation, phenomenon\textendash quality\textendash quantity conflation, numeral\textendash number conflation). These fallacies are maintained and masked by repeated conceptual back-and-forth switching between two incompatible epistemological frameworks, (a) an operationist framework of data modeling implemented through methodical and statistical operations and (b) a realist framework of measurement sporadically invoked in theoretical considerations but neither theoretically elaborated nor empirically implemented. The analyses demonstrate that psychometrics constitutes only data modeling but not data generation or even measurement as often assumed and that analogies to (indirect or fundamental) physical measurement are mistaken. They provide theoretical support for the increasing criticism of psychometrics and its use in research and applied contexts. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

This approach allows for previously infeasible investigations of the multi-dimensional nature of human experience as it unfolds in accordance with different temporal patterns on different timescales. In effect, the computational approach represents a rediscovery of the themes and ambitions that launched the field over a century ago.The book brings together social psychologists with varying topical interests who are taking the lead in this redirection of the field. Many present formal models that are implemented in computer simulations to test basic assumptions and investigate the emergence of higher-order properties; others develop models to fit the real-time evolution of people's inner states, overt behavior, and social interactions. Collectively, the contributions illustrate how the methods and tools of the computational approach can investigate, and transform, the diverse landscape of social psychology.},

We point out some of the risks of modeling and interpreting general factors, derived from the fields of intelligence and personality research. We argue that: (a) factor-analytic resolution, i.e., convergence of the literature on a particular factor structure, should not be expected in the presence of multiple highly similar models; and (b) the true underlying model may not be a factor model at all, because alternative explanations can account for the correlational structure of psychopathology.},

We follow with a description of the main techniques these AI breakthroughs were based upon, such as deep learning and reinforcement learning; two techniques that have deep roots in psychology. Next, we discuss how psychologically plausible AI is and could become given the modern breakthroughs in AI's ability to learn. We then access the main question of how intelligent AI systems actually are. For example, are there AI systems that can solve human intelligence tests? We conclude that Shank's observation, that intelligence is all about generalization and that AI is not particularly good at this, has, so far, withstood the test of time. Finally, we consider what AI insights could mean for the study of individual differences in intelligence. We close with how AI can further Intelligence research and vice versa, and look forward to fruitful interactions in the future.},

	abstract = {In the first part of the article, a conceptual framework is sketched to define cognitive growth, including language growth, as a process of growth under limited resources. Important concepts are the process, level, and rate of growth; minimal structural growth level; carrying capacity and unutilized capacity for growth; and feedback delay. Second, a mathematical model of cognitive growth under limited resources is presented, with the conclusion that the most plausible model is a model of logistic growth with delayed feedback. Third, the model is transformed into a dynamic systems model based on the logistic growth equation. This model describes cognitive growth as a system of supportive and competitive interactions between growers. Models of normal logistic growth, U-shaped growth, bootstrap growth, and competitive growth are also presented. An overview is presented of forms of adaptation of resources (e.g., parental and tutorial assistance and support) to the growth characteristics of a cognitive or linguistic competence. Finally, the question of how the model can account for stages of growth is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

@article{vangeliPredictorsAttemptsStop2011,
	abstract = {AIMS: To identify the predictors of attempts to stop smoking and the predictors of quit attempt success in adult general population samples. METHODS: We performed an electronic search of EMBASE, Pubmed, Web of Science, PsychINFO and the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group specialized register for articles that examined, in prospective adult general population samples, predictors of quit attempts and the success of quit attempts. Experts were contacted for knowledge of other relevant studies. Eight studies met the inclusion criteria and results were extracted independently by two researchers. RESULTS: There was considerable methodological heterogeneity between studies. Motivational factors dominated the prediction of quit attempts, whereas only cigarette dependence consistently predicted success after an attempt had been made. Social grade also appeared to predict success but was only examined in two studies. None of the other socio-demographic factors consistently predicted making a quit attempt or success. CONCLUSIONS: Population-level studies from a number of countries show that past quit attempts and measures of motivation to stop are highly predictive of quit attempts, whereas only measures of dependence are consistently predictive of success of those attempts. Gender, age and marital status and educational level are not related consistently to quit attempts or quit success across countries.},

Major findings in attitude formation and change involving both processing modes are reviewed and modeled from a connectionist perspective. We use an autoassociative network architecture with a linear activation update and the delta learning algorithm for adjusting the connection weights. The network is applied to well-known experiments involving deliberative attitude formation, as well as the use of heuristics of length, consensus, expertise, and mood. All these empirical phenomena are successfully reproduced in the simulations. Moreover, the proposed model is shown to be consistent with algebraic models of attitude formation (Fishbein \& Ajzen, 1975). The discussion centers on how the proposed network model may be used to unite and formalize current ideas and hypotheses on the processes underlying attitude acquisition and how it can be deployed to develop novel hypotheses in the attitude domain.},

@book{varelaEmbodiedMindRevised2017,
	abstract = {A new edition of a classic work that originated the ``embodied cognition'' movement and was one of the first to link science and Buddhist practices.This classic book, first published in 1991, was one of the first to propose the ``embodied cognition'' approach in cognitive science. It pioneered the connections between phenomenology and science and between Buddhist practices and science\textemdash claims that have since become highly influential. Through this cross-fertilization of disparate fields of study, The Embodied Mind introduced a new form of cognitive science called ``enaction,'' in which both the environment and first person experience are aspects of embodiment. However, enactive embodiment is not the grasping of an independent, outside world by a brain, a mind, or a self; rather it is the bringing forth of an interdependent world in and through embodied action. Although enacted cognition lacks an absolute foundation, the book shows how that does not lead to either experiential or philosophical nihilism. Above all, the book's arguments were powered by the conviction that the sciences of mind must encompass lived human experience and the possibilities for transformation inherent in human experience. This revised edition includes substantive introductions by Evan Thompson and Eleanor Rosch that clarify central arguments of the work and discuss and evaluate subsequent research that has expanded on the themes of the book, including the renewed theoretical and practical interest in Buddhism and mindfulness. A preface by Jon Kabat-Zinn, the originator of the mindfulness-based stress reduction program, contextualizes the book and describes its influence on his life and work.},

	abstract = {[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 122(1) of Psychological Review (see record 2014-57178-002). An inaccurate assumption in Appendix B (provided in the erratum) led to an oversimplified result in Equation 18 (the diffusion equations associated with the microscopically defined dynamics). The authors sincerely thank Rani Moran for making them aware of the problem. Only the expression of the diffusion coefficient D is incorrect, and should be changed, as indicated in the erratum. Both the cause of the problem and the solution are also explained in the erratum.] The Ising Decision Maker (IDM) is a new formal model for speeded two-choice decision making derived from the stochastic Hopfield network or dynamic Ising model. On a microscopic level, it consists of 2 pools of binary stochastic neurons with pairwise interactions. Inside each pool, neurons excite each other, whereas between pools, neurons inhibit each other. The perceptual input is represented by an external excitatory field. Using methods from statistical mechanics, the high-dimensional network of neurons (microscopic level) is reduced to a two-dimensional stochastic process, describing the evolution of the mean neural activity per pool (macroscopic level). The IDM can be seen as an abstract, analytically tractable multiple attractor network model of information accumulation. In this article, the properties of the IDM are studied, the relations to existing models are discussed, and it is shown that the most important basic aspects of two-choice response time data can be reproduced. In addition, the IDM is shown to predict a variety of observed psychophysical relations such as Pi\'eron's law, the van der Molen-Keuss effect, and Weber's law. Using Bayesian methods, the model is fitted to both simulated and real data, and its performance is compared to the Ratcliff diffusion model.

@book{visserMixtureHiddenMarkov2022,
	abstract = {This book discusses mixture and hidden Markov models for modeling behavioral data. Mixture and hidden Markov models are statistical models which are useful when an observed system occupies a number of distinct ``regimes'' or unobserved (hidden) states. These models are widely used in a variety of fields, including artificial intelligence, biology, finance, and psychology. Hidden Markov models can be viewed as an extension of mixture models, to model transitions between states over time. Covering both mixture and hidden Markov models in a single book allows main concepts and issues to be introduced in the relatively simpler context of mixture models. After a thorough treatment of the theory and practice of mixture modeling, the conceptual leap towards hidden Markov models is relatively straightforward. This book provides many practical examples illustrating the wide variety of uses of the models. These examples are drawn from our own work in psychology, as well as other areas such as financial time series and climate data. Most examples illustrate the use of the authors' depmixS4 package, which provides a flexible framework to construct and estimate mixture and hidden Markov models. All examples are fully reproducible and the accompanying hmmR package provides all the datasets used, as well as additional functionality. This book is suitable for advanced students and researchers with an applied background.},

All versions of this article have been corrected.] Panel studies, in which the same subjects are repeatedly observed at multiple time points, are among the most popular longitudinal designs in psychology. Meanwhile, there exists a wide range of different methods to analyze such data, with autoregressive and cross-lagged models being 2 of the most well known representatives. Unfortunately, in these models time is only considered implicitly, making it difficult to account for unequally spaced measurement occasions or to compare parameter estimates across studies that are based on different time intervals. Stochastic differential equations offer a solution to this problem by relating the discrete time model to its underlying model in continuous time. It is the goal of the present article to introduce this approach to a broader psychological audience. A step-by-step review of the relationship between discrete and continuous time modeling is provided, and we demonstrate how continuous time parameters can be obtained via structural equation modeling. An empirical example on the relationship between authoritarianism and anomia is used to illustrate the approach. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

In particular, the managed selection engine provides the foundations of the underlying principles of co-evolving self-renewing organizations: managing internal rates of change, optimizing self-organization, and balancing concurrent exploration and exploitation. However, it is altogether clear that empirical co-evolution research represents the next frontier for empirically resolving the adaptation selection debate.

Because of its continued relevance in modern psychology, this centennial anniversary is an excellent opportunity to take stock of what Gestalt psychology has offered and how it has changed since its inception. We first introduce the key findings and ideas in the Berlin school of Gestalt psychology, and then briefly sketch its development, rise, and fall. Next, we discuss its empirical and conceptual problems, and indicate how they are addressed in contemporary research on perceptual grouping and figure\textendash ground organization. In particular, we review the principles of grouping, both classical (e.g., proximity, similarity, common fate, good continuation, closure, symmetry, parallelism) and new (e.g., synchrony, common region, element and uniform connectedness), and their role in contour integration and completion. We then review classic and new image-based principles of figure\textendash ground organization, how it is influenced by past experience and attention, and how it relates to shape and depth perception. After an integrated review of the neural mechanisms involved in contour grouping, border ownership, and figure\textendash ground perception, we conclude by evaluating what modern vision science has offered compared to traditional Gestalt psychology, whether we can speak of a Gestalt revival, and where the remaining limitations and challenges lie. A better integration of this research tradition with the rest of vision science requires further progress regarding the conceptual and theoretical foundations of the Gestalt approach, which is the focus of a second review article.

In a recent article in this journal, Forbes, Wright, Markon, and Krueger (FWMK) voiced the concern that GGMs that are estimated from partial correlations wrongfully remove the variance that is shared by its constituents. If true, this concern has grave consequences for the application of GGMs. Indeed, if partial correlations only capture the unique covariances, then the data that come from a unidimensional latent variable model ULVM should be associated with an empty network (no edges), as there are no unique covariances in a ULVM. We know that this cannot be true, which suggests that FWMK are missing something with their claim. We introduce a connection between the ULVM and the GGM and use that connection to prove that we find a fully-connected and not an empty network associated with a ULVM. We then use the relation between GGMs and linear regression to show that the partial correlation indeed does not remove the common variance.},

@book{wheelerHomeUniverse1994,
	abstract = {Colleague and confidant of Einstein and Bohr, pioneer of nuclear fission theory, and staunch champion of the theory of black holes - John Archibald Wheeler is one of the most original and profound thinkers of modern science. In 1939 he published, with Niels Bohr, the first paper to describe nuclear fission successfully in terms of quantum physics, a ground-breaking study that led to his involvement in the Los Alamos atom bomb project and his subsequent work on the hydrogen bomb. Wheeler has made significant contributions to atomic and nuclear physics, elementary-particle physics, relativity theory, cosmology, and astrophysics. Yet, in the final analysis, it is his simple delight and wonder in "the machinery of existence" that illuminates this collection. At Home in the Universe presents a feast of engaging essays formed of reminiscence, science, and conjecture. Wheeler provides intimate glimpses of Einstein, Bohr, and other giants in the field who were his friends and collaborators. He writes of debates and discussions with Bohr that formed the cornerstone of nuclear fission theory, long talks with Einstein in his upstairs study at Princeton, and the eloquence and nobility of Hermann Weyl. He sees in these and other great physicists - Marie Curie, Hideki Yukawa, and Hendrik Anthony Kramers - exemplars of the scientific spirit. Wheeler ranges over what he calls the "intensely human activity" of science, the nature of scientific endeavor, the role of curiosity and creativity, characteristics of good scientists, and scientific skepticism and optimism. He delves into new directions of physics, notably his intriguing proposition that reality can be thought of as binary units - or "bits" -similar to those from information theory. Uniting the collection is Wheeler's lifelong passion for the truth and his unconcealed joy in its pursuit. An unforgettable journey through the mind and memory of one of the century's great physicists, At Home in the Universe will delight, educate, and inspire.},

@book{wienerCyberneticsControlCommunication2019,
	abstract = {A classic and influential work that laid the theoretical foundations for information theory and a timely text for contemporary informations theorists and practitioners.With the influential book Cybernetics, first published in 1948, Norbert Wiener laid the theoretical foundations for the multidisciplinary field of cybernetics, the study of controlling the flow of information in systems with feedback loops, be they biological, mechanical, cognitive, or social. At the core of Wiener's theory is the message (information), sent and responded to (feedback); the functionality of a machine, organism, or society depends on the quality of messages. Information corrupted by noise prevents homeostasis, or equilibrium. And yet Cybernetics is as philosophical as it is technical, with the first chapter devoted to Newtonian and Bergsonian time and the philosophical mixed with the technical throughout. This book brings the 1961 second edition back into print, with new forewords by Doug Hill and Sanjoy Mitter. Contemporary readers of Cybernetics will marvel at Wiener's prescience\textemdash his warnings against ``noise,'' his disdain for ``hucksters'' and ``gadget worshipers,'' and his view of the mass media as the single greatest anti-homeostatic force in society. This edition of Cybernetics gives a new generation access to a classic text.},

	abstract = {Alcohol lapses are the modal outcome following treatment for alcohol use disorders, yet many alcohol researchers have encountered limited success in the prediction and prevention of relapse. One hypothesis is that lapses are unpredictable, but another possibility is the complexity of the relapse process is not captured by traditional statistical methods. Data from Project Matching Alcohol Treatments to Client Heterogeneity (Project MATCH), a multisite alcohol treatment study, were reanalyzed with 2 statistical methodologies: catastrophe and 2-part growth mixture modeling. Drawing on previous investigations of self-efficacy as a dynamic predictor of relapse, the current study revisits the self-efficacy matching hypothesis, which was not statistically supported in Project MATCH. Results from both the catastrophe and growth mixture analyses demonstrated a dynamic relationship between self-efficacy and drinking outcomes. The growth mixture analyses provided evidence in support of the original matching hypothesis: Individuals with lower self-efficacy who received cognitive behavior therapy drank far less frequently than did those with low self-efficacy who received motivational therapy. These results highlight the dynamical nature of the relapse process and the importance of the use of methodologies that accommodate this complexity when evaluating treatment outcomes.

@article{wittenbornDepressionSystemicSyndrome2016,
	abstract = {BackgroundDepression is a complex public health problem with considerable variation in treatment response. The systemic complexity of depression, or the feedback processes among diverse drivers of the disorder, contribute to the persistence of depression. This paper extends prior attempts to understand the complex causal feedback mechanisms that underlie depression by presenting the first broad boundary causal loop diagram of depression dynamics.MethodWe applied qualitative system dynamics methods to map the broad feedback mechanisms of depression. We used a structured approach to identify candidate causal mechanisms of depression in the literature. We assessed the strength of empirical support for each mechanism and prioritized those with support from validation studies. Through an iterative process, we synthesized the empirical literature and created a conceptual model of major depressive disorder.ResultsThe literature review and synthesis resulted in the development of the first causal loop diagram of reinforcing feedback processes of depression. It proposes candidate drivers of illness, or inertial factors, and their temporal functioning, as well as the interactions among drivers of depression. The final causal loop diagram defines 13 key reinforcing feedback loops that involve nine candidate drivers of depression.ConclusionsFuture research is needed to expand upon this initial model of depression dynamics. Quantitative extensions may result in a better understanding of the systemic syndrome of depression and contribute to personalized methods of evaluation, prevention and intervention.},

@article{youngCausalityPsychiatryHybrid2015,
	abstract = {Causality or etiology in psychiatry is marked by standard biomedical, reductionistic models (symptoms reflect the construct involved) that inform approaches to nosology, or classification, such as in the DSM-5 [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition; (1)]. However, network approaches to symptom interaction [i.e., symptoms are formative of the construct; e.g., (2), for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)] are being developed that speak to bottom-up processes in mental disorder, in contrast to the typical top-down psychological construct approach. The present article presents a hybrid top-down, bottom-up model of the relationship between symptoms and mental disorder, viewing symptom expression and their causal complex as a reciprocally dynamic system with multiple levels, from lower-order symptoms in interaction to higher-order constructs affecting them. The hybrid model hinges on good understanding of systems theory in which it is embedded, so that the article reviews in depth non-linear dynamical systems theory (NLDST). The article applies the concept of emergent circular causality (3) to symptom development, as well. Conclusions consider that symptoms vary over several dimensions, including: subjectivity; objectivity; conscious motivation effort; and unconscious influences, and the degree to which individual (e.g., meaning) and universal (e.g., causal) processes are involved. The opposition between science and skepticism is a complex one that the article addresses in final comments.},

The opinion interaction occurs by one randomly chosen pair at each time step. The difference to the original Deffuant-Weisbuch model is that communications of any selected pairs will be affected by noises. The aim of this paper is to study the robust consensus of this noisy Deffuant-Weisbuch model. We first define the noise strength as the maximum noise absolute value. We will then show that when the noise strength is less than a certain threshold, this noisy model will achieve robust consensus when is sufficiently large; next we prove that the noisy model achieves robust consensus with a positive probability; finally, we demonstrate these results and provide numerical relations among the noise strength and some model parameters.},

@article{zwickerApplyingAttitudeNetwork2020,
	abstract = {In a time of rapid climate change, understanding what may encourage sustainable consumer behaviour is a vital but difficult challenge. Using an attitude network approach, we investigated which associations people have towards conventional and bio-based plastic in order to develop an empirically-based approach to initiate attitude- and behaviour change. With a qualitative study (N~=~97), we distilled 25 evaluative reactions (i.e. beliefs, emotions, and behaviours) that encompass people's attitudes towards using (bio-based) plastic. These reactions were used to create a new scale, which was subsequently tested among 508 online participants. The resulting data was then used to build a network displaying relationships between participants' evaluative reactions regarding plastic use. Analyses of this network indicated that guilt was most strongly connected to people's willingness to pay more for bio-based plastic products. Based on this, we conducted another study (N~=~285) in which we experimentally manipulated guilt (general guilt, personal guilt, and control condition) to determine its effects on people's willingness to pay for a sustainable cause. Results indicate that manipulating guilt can lead participants to donate more to a sustainable cause. This effect was fully mediated by self-reported guilt. Determining which factors influence consumers to change their buying behaviour towards sustainability is the first step in creating a demand for more sustainable products amongst the public and investors.},
