## DRAFT - Margins & Call outs {.unnumbered}

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

[This is a span that has the class aside which places it in the margin without a footnote number.]{.aside}

It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

## Python code (click to expand)

``` {.python eval="FALSE"}
# Python program to check if the input number is odd or even.
# A number is even if division by 2 gives a remainder of 0.
# If the remainder is 1, it is an odd number.

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if (num % 2) == 0:
   print("{0} is Even".format(num))
else:
   print("{0} is Odd".format(num))

  })
}
```

## Python
